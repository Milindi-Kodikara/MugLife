@Jggppu6,"It may sound normie to Dubstep purists, and pretentious to brostep fans; but this type of slow Dubstep, with dirty bass and broken rhythms typical of the years 2010/2011 It was an aesthetically and technically innovative and interesting style, it had an experimental touch, something complex and slightly aggressive, it still retained the rhythms of classic Dubstep, but it already had the bases of the sound that brostep would have in the future, although brostep would become less melodic, colder, with more predictable rhythms and focused on the energy of rave, therefore more generic.",1,2024-09-30T17:22:57Z

@Official-lele911,"Tell me the duck story<br>Bum bum bum, ba-dum ba-dum<br>A duck walked up to a lemonade stand<br>And he said to the man, running the stand<br>&quot;Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?&quot;<br>The man said &quot;No, we just sell lemonade<br>But it’s cold and it&#39;s fresh, and it’s all home-made.<br>Can I get you a glass?&quot;<br>The duck said “I’ll pass.”Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>&#39;Til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum<br>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand<br>And he said to the man, running the stand<br>&quot;Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?<br>No, like I said yesterday<br>We just sell lemonade. Okay?<br>Why not give it a try?&quot;<br>The duck said &quot;Goodbye.&quot;Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>&#39;Til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum<br>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand<br>And he said to the man running the stand<br>&quot;Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?<br>The man said &quot;Look, this is getting old<br>I mean, lemonade’s all we’ve ever sold<br>Why not give it a go<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle waddle<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>&#39;Til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum<br><br><br>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand<br>And he said to the man running the stand<br>&quot;Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?&quot;<br>The man said &quot;THAT’S IT! If you don’t stay away, Duck<br>I’ll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day, stuck<br>So don’t get too close!&quot;<br>The duck said &quot;Adios.&quot;<br><br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle waddle<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>&#39;Til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum<br><br><br>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand<br>And he said to the man running the stand<br>&quot;Hey! (Bum bum bum) got any glue?&quot;<br>&quot;What?&quot; &quot;Got any glue?&quot;<br>&quot;No, why would I– oh!&quot;<br>Then one more question for you<br>&quot;Got any grapes?&quot;<br>(Bum bum bum, bum bum bum)<br><br>[Bridge]<br>And the man just stopped, then he started to smile<br>He started to laugh, he laughed for a while<br>He said “Come on duck, let’s walk to the store<br>I’ll buy you some grapes so you won’t have to ask anymore.”<br>So they walked to the store and the man bought some grapes<br>He gave one to the duck and the duck said “Hmm... No thanks<br><br>But you know what sounds good?<br>It would make my day<br>Do you think this store...<br>Do you think this store...<br>Do you think this store...<br>Has any… lemonade?”<br><br>[Refrain]<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle waddle<br>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle<br><br><br><br>i love this song",3,2024-10-14T12:34:35Z

@dewikaikesi,"Eminem&#39;s 2000 song “Stan” is a cautionary tale about an obsessed fan who kills himself and his girlfriend after Eminem doesn&#39;t respond to his letters. The song was inspired by disturbing fan mail Eminem received after releasing his second album, The Slim Shady LP. The song was written as a message to fans not to take his lyrics literally.",1,2024-10-14T02:25:03Z

Man or woman to kill their whole family just cause they’re a fan. I think Em got a little carried away with himself there. Still a great song. Music video is a little far-fetched though.

There was this 80s Group Karaoke thing that was going on and for some time, like 3 songs straight, there was some fumbling and a lot of people not knowing the lyrics to the song but then Living On A Prayer began playing and I am pretty sure the over 100 people there were singing in unison! People from all over the country, of different races, ages and backgrounds just singing out this super iconic song together!

@NickWindham,"“Pshh, man it’s hot,”  says an alleged roofer that chose to be dropped off for one of his routine 12 mile jogs. On a 100 degree day, it’s 150 degrees on a roof.  Standing on the side of the road sipping water for a guy conditioned  for that would feel like how 75 degrees feels to us.  Also, how many guys jog wearing a glove on the railroad tracks in wife-beater undershirt?<br><br>That poor good hearted officer probably never heard the end of jokes about this one at his expense, even after they promoted him.",0,2024-08-25T16:24:05Z

@marksimmons5665,"Fifty years ago today, I was in Cardiff South Wales, walked into Woolworths, not my first choice of store to buy records, but there it was, …&#39;Killer Queen&#39;, it was the 11th October, 1974. I’d already heard of Queen, who hadn’t - we’d already listened to the incredible &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; and &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;. It wasn’t until I heard Killer Queen on the radio that I felt that the band Queen was going to be special. It’s 50 years, and so much has happened in both my personal life, and of course Queen’s. <br><br>When Queen released Killer Queen, as a young twelve and a half year old, ready to conquer the world - I didn’t, but Queen certainly did.

@saulgoodman6358,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I&#39;m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don&#39;t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I&#39;m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I&#39;m trying to explain that I&#39;m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
