Colombo,cafe,Grind,ChIJi3zVQ7dZ4joRFg8yFg2C53s,Access Towers 2,4.7,Kasun Sameera,"I recently had the pleasure of enjoying brunch at Grind in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and it was an absolutely delightful experience. The food was incredibly tasty, with each dish bursting with flavor and freshness. The drinks were equally impressive, perfectly complementing the meal with their refreshing and well-balanced taste.

The ambiance of Grind is warm and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing brunch. The staff were friendly and attentive, ensuring that our dining experience was top-notch from start to finish. I highly recommend Grind for anyone looking to enjoy a delicious meal in a cozy and welcoming environment.

For parking you'd have to go to the top car park and take the elevator to the ground floor."
Colombo,cafe,Grind,ChIJi3zVQ7dZ4joRFg8yFg2C53s,Access Towers 2,4.7,Prabu Deepan,"Loved it. It was my first time here, and it was a great experience. The food was fresh and tasty, the service was fast, and it's decently priced. They have a wide variety of coffee flavours. They were also quite flexible in making sure we got what we wanted. That Mac and Cheese (only from 11am) was delicious.

I'm not a huge fan of the lobby area coffee dining experience, but I guess it works for people when the food and service is good, everything else is secondary?

I will go back for sure."
Colombo,cafe,Grind,ChIJi3zVQ7dZ4joRFg8yFg2C53s,Access Towers 2,4.7,Isabella Grandic,"Cafe at the bottom of an office building. Atmosphere is so-so. Smaller menu than the one at seeds. The avocado toast was good. Felt a bit small for the price. Lacked some spice/flavour? Wish the toast was thicker. I had to add a good amount of salt. Smoothie was nice, refreshing.

No ambience music or vibes really. No wifi. Has AC."
Colombo,cafe,Grind,ChIJi3zVQ7dZ4joRFg8yFg2C53s,Access Towers 2,4.7,Thashy Abey,"This is a great place for anything. You can have yummy dishes regardless of breakfast, brunch, dinner and evening coffee. All the options are healthy food and they will accommodate your preferences in terms of salt, spicy level and everything. Staff is extremely friendly and they will constantly provide you a great service for you to have a quality time. The ambiance is super with great lighting and spacious enough for bigger crowds as well. The prices are affordable and value for money is there in every aspect."
Colombo,cafe,Grind,ChIJi3zVQ7dZ4joRFg8yFg2C53s,Access Towers 2,4.7,Dinushi Perera,"The Grind in Colombo is an absolute gem and undeniably the best cafe in the city. From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the cozy ambiance and the welcoming atmosphere. The food is simply amazing, and every penny spent here is worth it.

The highlight of my visit was the Korean Chicken Fried Burger and the Gochujang Chicken Mac and Cheese. The burger was a flavor explosion, perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with the right balance of spices. The Gochujang Chicken Mac and Cheese was the epitome of comfort food‚Äîcreamy, cheesy, with a delightful kick from the gochujang. It was perfect in every way.

To top it all off, I had the best cold Milo I've ever tasted. It was refreshing and perfectly sweetened, making it a perfect companion to the savory dishes.

I absolutely love this place and will definitely make it a point to visit The Grind again when I return to Sri Lanka. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in Colombo"
Colombo,cafe,Seed Cafe,ChIJz7qI5YxZ4joRAr5V7munQxo,"60 Horton Pl, Colombo",4.6,Vivekananda Bheemisetty,"We read about this cafe and we're excited to visit the Cafe. We were there for a quick grab. The place was just as described. It was calm, surreal. I went there with my 4 months old baby and the staff were kind enough to let us use the bean bag for my baby. The food was really good. We had the salmon bagel and a smoothie bowl. They were both yummy. the cold brew and cappuccino were just perfect. Some merchandise is displaced at the entrance which is really cute. They also have a cute boutique within the cafe. Perfect for a Sunday morning just to relax and sip a nice cuppa coffee ‚òï"
Colombo,cafe,Seed Cafe,ChIJz7qI5YxZ4joRAr5V7munQxo,"60 Horton Pl, Colombo",4.6,Isabella Grandic,Super cute cafe with fans and comfy seats! No wifi. Smoothie bowls are lovely - just need a bit more fresh fruit! The lunch bowls are pretty good too. Latte was too milky. Cappuccino was nice.

Colombo,cafe,Seed Cafe,ChIJz7qI5YxZ4joRAr5V7munQxo,"60 Horton Pl, Colombo",4.6,Mariam Kodalashvili,"Very good place to enjoy your breakfast or lunch. Good choice of healthy food options.

We tried Bagel with Salmon, only thing is that the bagel was too hard to cut, otherwise taste was good.

They have on of the best coffee in Colombo, also with vegan optiona (almond, oat). Breakfast bowls are very tasty, we've tried Mango Smoothie bowl, it was very light, yet filling. You can add extras on top as well.

Keep in mind that on weekends it is hard to find a seat and is always very hot, even though they have fans, it's still hard to breath.

The service is fast and nice. Dishes are prepared beautifully, nicely served.

You can enjoy a good lunch with lots of bowl options, they're not too big, but you will enjoy.

Make sure to try their oatmeal cookie, as it is one of the best."
Colombo,cafe,Seed Cafe,ChIJz7qI5YxZ4joRAr5V7munQxo,"60 Horton Pl, Colombo",4.6,Cassia Attard,"Absolutely banging. Everything we ordered was great, and everything we saw looked amazing. The coffee is really good and made with a real espresso machine üòç.
The roasted hummus bowl was good. Nothing crazy but very nourishing.
Iced Americano and Iced Latte were both great.
The avocado sandwich thing looks great. They have Turkish eggs which sounded amazing.
Lots of smoothie bowl, salad, burger, pasta and other healthy options.
Meals are 1800-2600 LKR."
Colombo,cafe,Cafe Kinross,ChIJ3aO6wKlb4joRiuzg0tgJ-XQ,"6 Kinross Ave, Colombo",4.6,Samithu Hettiarachchi,"While trying to find a place to crash for 1-2 hours, we discovered this amazing place from google maps. The aesthetics, background music and food specially the pizza was really good and reasonably priced. They have some offers on certein dates which are really value worthy. Also they do Srilankan and Italian buffets on selected dates. Recommended for anyone who's looking to spend some good comfortable time with amaizing food and drinks"
Colombo,cafe,Cafe Kinross,ChIJ3aO6wKlb4joRiuzg0tgJ-XQ,"6 Kinross Ave, Colombo",4.6,Gogula Aryalingam,"A quaint indoor/outdoor cafe on Kinross Ave. Started off with coffee. The cafe latte was very good; good size as well. So was the caramel frappe. The caramel macchiato however was smaller and lukewarm. Ordered two savoury pittus; one chicken, one prawn; and a homemade meatballs with garlic rice. The pittus were very tasty, a bit dry but compensated with coconut milk. The chicken and prawn curries were very good, with the prawn not stinged upon. The meals took a little longer than expected but it's pittu and it needs to be made. However, they'd forgotten the meatballs and had to be reminded which they hastily had to make which ended with a disastrous kankun that tasted heavily of Astra and salty with too much soy sauce. The meatballs were however quite good. Overall, was happy with the meal despite the little setbacks. The price was totally worth it for the portion sizes. When paying, I asked about a published credit card discount to which there was a direct ""no"". I had to show the bank publication, and the cashier calling someone to find out and finally providing the discount. That, and the mess up in not getting the order right shows that their service needs a looking into."

We loved the seafood Pol roti kottu. We ordered the vege loaded halloumi rice which was tasty but which was a little too sweet for our liking. Prices are reasonable and the portions are good.

Another good thing about the place is that it has power outlets allowing you to get your work done while having a nice meal. The staff is friendly. If you are an introvert it‚Äôs ideal since they have the option to scan their menu and place your order ( allows you to pay online or by cash). The food will be delivered to your table with no fuss."

The order didn‚Äôt have Chicken in the Salad and when inquired the management and staff mentioned the chef is new and he is not experienced. When asked to send a new order they said can‚Äôt do that. Absolutely terrible service and food. Do not recommend this place

Colombo,cafe,Hebrews Cafe,ChIJZSNjUfJZ4joRsvHXujZP20M,"WW52+23J, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte",4.4,Manik Dissanayake,"Good place to hag out for a coffee and snack. Good comfortable seating and atmosphere. Staff also friendly and helpful.

Choice is good in the menu from snacks to a complete meal. Kind of coffee shop to chill and have meetings and do work.

However they don‚Äôt have WiFi so bring your own internet connection if you need it.

Parking availability is good as about 10 vehicles can be parked. It‚Äôs just next to chinese dragon and Pizza Hut so you can‚Äôt miss it on the main road towards Battaramulla from Borella.

Food is great and although on the high side I believe it‚Äôs value for money for the overall experience you will have.

This is targeted at middle ans high income segments hence note when costing same of your ok a tight budget.

Should try their Kottu it‚Äôs really good.

Would recommend this place"

The fish curry was really good with fresh tuna. The chicken curry was also good.
The egg hopper was definitely a favourite over cheese.

10th August 2024 Dinner Takeaway from Cafe on the 5th, Colombo 3
Ordered Hoppers set with Chicken curry and seeni sambol
Total paid Rs.1,950
Two egg hoppers, 4 plain hoppers with Seeni sambol and Chicken Curry was my choice. Must say that their hoppers are crispy and tasty. Only disspointment was that their egg hoppers are not that tasty because their eggs are not of good quality. Should have been golden yolk. Also they should sprinkle some salt and pepper on the egg hoppers. That would make it better. Their seeni sambol was tasty and up to mark. Chicken curry was kind of ok. Nothing so exciting, just a regular curry."

Colombo,cafe,Lounge 171,ChIJncJmN35a4joRNFpRA6ZhldY,"171 Old Kottawa Rd, Maharagama",4.4,Sudam Gallage,"Improvements: the place is hard to find they should have better signage out front and in shop because there is a bakery on the bottom floor and no sign of the existence of a lounge, I had to ask the wait staff then unnecessarily walk up extra flights of stairs and open random doors leading to nowhere when in actuality the lounge was hidden near the stairwell.
The general vibe is very calming but it needs more character and better job at cleaning it looks standard and a bit unclean.
The servers need to be educated on the items on the menu and they kept saying wrong descriptions

Praise; the servers were very kind and polite and helpful and always on standby granted there weren't many customers, maybe can't find the place üòÖ
Finally the food well it was nothing but exemplary, each item was crafted meticulously and to perfection, the portions are adequate but it was a bit expensive compared to similar offerings.

Overall it's good but they need a few improvements which may take some time and work"

Colombo,cafe,Lounge 171,ChIJncJmN35a4joRNFpRA6ZhldY,"171 Old Kottawa Rd, Maharagama",4.4,Dinisuru Gunarathna,"I recently visited Lounge 171 with some of my colleagues, and our experience was nothing short of delightful. We had a Crispy Chicken Burger, an Artisan Lamb Burger, a Seafood Marinara Pizza, and two servings of french fries (although the burgers already came with fries).

Lounge 171 shines in its offerings of Thin Crust Pizza and delicious burgers. It's an ideal spot for both couples and friends looking for a great hangout. The ambiance is serene, with comfortable seating and a well-maintained atmosphere. The service was friendly, and our food arrived promptly.

The Seafood Marinara Pizza was a standout, boasting a unique flavor profile not found elsewhere. Any kind of Pizza in here is a must try. The crispy chicken burger and artisan lamb burger were equally impressive, generously loaded with cheese and perfectly portioned meats. We found that ordering extra fries was unnecessary, as the burger portions already included a sufficient serving per person.

Lounge 171 combines a bakery and the restaurant in the same place. The cleanliness, exceptional service, and mouthwatering food make this establishment a must-visit. The prices are bit high compared to other places (with service charge and VAT), but try the varities at least once. Also they do have enough parking space in both sides of the road.

I highly recommend Lounge 171 for a delightful dining experience!"

My absolute favorite is the Crispy Chicken Burger, paired with their sweet potato fries ‚Äì hands down the best I‚Äôve ever had! The burger is perfectly cooked, juicy, and packed with flavor, while the fries are crispy, lightly seasoned, and perfectly balanced with a touch of sweetness.

The ambiance is a major highlight, with its chic interiors, comfortable seating, and warm lighting creating the perfect environment to unwind. The staff are always attentive, friendly, and efficient, adding a personal touch that makes every visit feel special. Despite economic ups and downs, Cafe Noir Blanc has managed to maintain its high quality and welcoming vibe, making it a truly reliable spot in the city.

- The interior is bloody brilliant and calming just how a cafe should be

It is a full rice comes with chili paste as a condiment. But that very small amount of chili paste they give for that full rice is not enough for one person. And that‚Äôs the only this comes with the rice portion. When we request to add more chili paste, they charge extra for it. But when you dine in, it‚Äôs unlimited.

We were the only customers at the time, and the service was attentive. However, we felt the server could have given us a bit more space to browse the menu before hovering to see what we'd choose. It wasn't a major issue, though.

We started with drinks - a chocolate milkshake and an iced coffee. Both were delicious. Unfortunately, the chicken sandwiches we ordered later were disappointing. I'd heard good things about this place in the past, so I hope the food quality improves in the future."

Whether you‚Äôre a coffee connoisseur or just looking for a cozy spot to relax, Life's Good Kitchen is definitely worth a visit. I‚Äôll definitely be returning soon!"

The owner was very polite and humble man. We didn‚Äôt forget to appreciate his work before leaving the place.

They have special dishes and beverages for the day. If you ask from them you‚Äôll be able to choose the best dish as per your choice.

The cafe mocha was a definite hit. I tried their special drink for the day, the tamarind juice. It was nice.
The taste of food was more than the level we expected.

The owners spent about two decades working in the Maldives and brought that spin here in every way. The it feels like you‚Äôre dining in the rainforest.

I had 3 meals here and I can‚Äôt wait to go again before I go!

The atmosphere is calm, on account of all the plants and decor, the outdoorsy feel, and the well-chosen ambient music. The coffee was the best I've had in Colombo (I'm from Melbourne, Australia, perhaps the coffee capital of the world... so I know what good coffee tastes like). I had a smoothie bowl, and it was yummo. Pricing above average for Colombo (see pictures for menu) but well-priced for what you get.

I had a chat to the owner - Shamika - who has done a beautiful job, along with her husband. They are ex-hoteliers, and know how to operate a venue properly. They did all the plants themselves, which is worth a look even if you're not hungry!

Greatly enjoyed my breakfast here, and will be attempting to replicate the smoothie bowl at home."

Right now it's not so great. We've dined there many times. We keep going back because we have a taste for their food. But it's always a gamble. Their ghee rice and beef smore with mash are our favorites. But the last outing the ghee rice was useless. Going on a day and at a time when they're busy is not a good idea - that's usually when their meals suck. Going after hours - you risk certain dishes to be unavailable. Their juices, though have remained consistent. Their homemade ginger beer and naran juice are out of this world. They claim authenticity of their lamprais, even taking a dig, on their menu, at other restaurants who serve lamprais - but I dunno, didn't seem the greatest, quite dry also. Or maybe I don't know what real lamprais should taste like. Service-wise their waiters are friendly, but takes a while to get their attention once they serve the food - mainly because they're rushing about. The atmosphere is nice, giving off a laid back, a slightly poshish Sri Lankan vibe."

The new owner is compromising so much on quality from fresh pineapples to canned pineapple which has a terrible after taste of sugar syrup, the frosting is so thin and dry.  A waste of money for RS. 130-150 a piece. Same with the Lamprai it was so utterly dry and had no flavor.

I would stick with the original owners of the business who still run on small scale as Rodrigo's for anyone looking to still have an experience of the local authentic taste.

Many months later they respond on google saying they will resolve this and to contact them but there is no response. Terrible customer service. A great brand gone down to shambles because of poor management. Screenshot attached of them not responding to their messages even though they said below they would."

We have been very loyal customers of Green Cabin for ages and then shifted towards you since your inception.

However, it was disgusting to note that, there was a Cockroach Egg in one of the Chicken Rolls we purchased from your Malalasekara Mw outlet. We found it whilst dining there and when informed the staff, they too agreed it was what we thought it was. And they were nice and they immediately informed one of the managers and asked me to WhatsApp the images to him and they wanted to keep the same in the refrigerator and show to the management.

All I asked was to get someone responsible to call me, and let me know the action they take.

Yet, I am awaiting to hear from this establishment ü§î??? My question to all my friends and general public who patronize this place is that, how funny they take us for granted and ignored at a crucial matter.

The absence of hot drinks (tea, coffee, etc.) sometimes leaves us with no option but to visit alternative places. Presence of female staff would also have been lovely.

I have ordered twice from here and have had the same experience even after telling them not to be so stingy!!! They charge us high end prices but delivery us products like this? Never going to buy from here again.

Colombo,cafe,The Barnesbury,ChIJmaQrW3ZZ4joRorGVvcDlIb8,"91 Barnes Pl, Colombo",4.3,Amalan Dhananjayan (Batzee),"Came here for an office lunch out.
We have given the orders the previous day for 25+ people and they are ready and within 30 mins we are provided the food. The service is good.

They have a good variety of food selections.

The place can accommodate several groups of people. They have outdoor and indoor seating available.

With free wifi it's a good place to work as well. It has a good working atmosphere.

Prices are on the expensive side.

If you want a calm getaway in the middle of the busy city with good food and a place to work I would highly recommend this place."

It is a quiet and cozy place idea for a conversation.

The buffalo wings were decent, 5 pcs a plate.

The beef pepper steak may have its quirks, the sauce is sure to delight‚Äîjust remember to specify your preferred doneness for a perfect dish.

Their gourmet chicken burger won't disappoint

Their strawberry crush was rather sweet but the lime and apple crush was a winner.

Fun Fact: Barnesbury has a couple of board games available to choose from."

The food was served freshly and the presentation was amazing.
I would like to mention about the service provided by the staff was just beyond exceptional. From the greetings to checking if everything is okay while we dine to the bye was amazing to see in a restaurant/cafe in Colombo.
Hats off to the cheese & BBQ panini ü§§

The cafe has a lovely, welcoming atmosphere that's perfect for relaxing and enjoying good food.

The menu offered a great variety of options, from classic breakfast dishes to lighter snacks. We all found something we loved. The portions were generous, and the food was delicious. The service was friendly and attentive, making us feel right at home.

If you read this before visiting - please order the Sweet Potato Fries"

We were greeted upon entry by possibly the manager, there was no way of knowing as he promptly sat down and continued a business meeting. There were no other customers in.
I wanted to try a speciality tea, all that was on the menu was a ceylon black tea.
I specifically wanted a light tea, I was advised to go into the shop and see what they suggested. The server had no knowledge of the teas.
Eventually the tea arrived, it had been brewing for so long it had stewed.
Not at all a pleasant experience. So glad we didn't eat here."

Colombo,cafe,KIKU Colombo,ChIJmcE9XHNb4joRvAYWs3QwrSI,"Layards Rd, Colombo",4.4,Natasha R,"This was easily one of the most disappointing dining experiences I‚Äôve had. The establishment appeared completely disorganized. Upon arrival, the security guard was fast asleep in the middle of the afternoon, with half his body obstructing the stairs. To make matters worse, as we ascended the stairs, one side led to an open restroom with staff hanging around, while the other side led to the caf√© ‚Äì not the most welcoming setup.

We tried a few items, none of which were remotely worth their price. The Rose Lemonade was essentially a mix of sherbet syrup and Sprite for Rs. 900. The Mango and Passion Fruit drink, which tasted mostly of passion fruit, was priced at an unreasonable Rs. 1,700. As for the food, the prawn and squid toast was a single slice of bread cut in half and sliced again in the middle with a little bit of prawn filling for Rs. 1,600, and the 6 pieces of Gyoza were tasteless and cost Rs. 1,500. None of the items offered any flavor worth noting.

Despite having a large number of staff, the service was incredibly slow. You‚Äôre expected to collect the menu, place your order, and figure out most things on your own, as many of the staff seemed unaware of what was in each dish. I tried asking a question at the counter, but the cashier was more engaged in a conversation with another staff member and seemed indifferent to customers.

Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this caf√©. The atmosphere, service, and food quality all fell far below expectations."
Colombo,cafe,KIKU Colombo,ChIJmcE9XHNb4joRvAYWs3QwrSI,"Layards Rd, Colombo",4.4,Nadia Janvi,"KIKU is a very aesthetic place with a very pleasant ambience. The place is well kept and clean. The furnishing is quite pleasant and aesthetically appealing. However, the entrance has a long staircase and the restaurant itself is sort of hidden from being properly noticed.

The food and beverages taste really good. So far we have tried the Honey Butter French Toast, Lavendar latte, Matcha and Udon Kimchi Carbonara. The taste was heavenly but the portion sizes were small, especially when compared to their unit price.

The staff were friendly and welcoming. They are also very supportive when it comes to helping the customers select the dishes from the menu.

The washroom was clean and well kept, with a pleasant atmosphere and smell.

I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is interested in hanging out with friends, looking to work from a cafe, going on a date or even to spend some time alone."

Upon stepping in, you'll be greeted by the enticing aroma of freshly prepared waffles that will surely whet your appetite. Their collection of savory and dessert waffles is truly impressive, catering to both sweet and savory cravings.
The portion size is generous, making it an ideal spot to visit with a friend or loved one
there's one area of improvement, it would be the seating arrangements. While the food itself is fantastic, having dedicated seating would enhance the overall dining experience. Eating the waffles hot is key to fully savoring their deliciousness, so having a comfortable space to sit down and enjoy them would be a valuable addition."

A large selection of desserts for every taste. The staff is very friendly, the prices are average. The downside is that there is no place to eat in the establishment, and you have to take food with you. However, you can do as I did and take the elevator to the 6th floor and eat on the summer terrace of the shopping center."
