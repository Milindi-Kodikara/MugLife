Melbourne,cafe,The Quarter,ChIJzRa1FbRC1moR01tSbLByQ8s,"27-31 Degraves St, Melbourne",4.3,Radinsa Dharmadasa,Food was really nice and the staff were lovely. We got the pork belly and lamb ribs for main and the tiramisu and mudcake for dessert. A thing to note is the dessert portion sizes are massive so you can definitely share one between people. My mum and I got one each and ended up taking half of both home.
Melbourne,cafe,The Quarter,ChIJzRa1FbRC1moR01tSbLByQ8s,"27-31 Degraves St, Melbourne",4.3,Cass C,"With so many options in Degraves, I decided to try The Quarter, but unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations. I ordered the pulled pork eggs Benedict and the New York bagel, but both dishes were missing key elements. The eggs Benedict was supposed to come with crunchy crackling, which was absent, and the New York bagel didn‚Äôt have the mayo as advertised on the menu.

On the bright side, the eggs were cooked well, and the Hollandaise sauce was tasty. However, the service left something to be desired‚Äîalthough our waiter was good the service from the food runners felt a bit abrupt, which added to the overall disappointment.

With so many great spots nearby, I might explore other options next time."
Melbourne,cafe,The Quarter,ChIJzRa1FbRC1moR01tSbLByQ8s,"27-31 Degraves St, Melbourne",4.3,Parttimepiggy,"One thing I love about Melbourne is the hidden laneway gems like these ‚≠êÔ∏è you have to check this place out if you haven‚Äôt already!

What we ordered:
üçÉ Zucchini Flowers $26
ü§ç Scallops Linguine $34.50
üçÖ Rigatoni all'Amatriciana $27
ü§é Tiramisu $16.50

The food and the ambience here makes for the perfect hang out spot whether you're having a date night or catching up with friends & family. They even had live music on when we visited on a Thursday evening and it was such a vibe!

Onto the food, everything we ate was yum but my favourite dish was definitely the rigatoni. I'm not normally a big fan of tomato / red sauce base pastas but wow this one was sensational. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the bits of pancetta were pan fried to perfection.

Also if you come here make sure to leave some room for their dessert! I was pleasantly surprised at how big the tiramisu serving was and it was soooo delicious. I like that it wasn‚Äôt overly sweet and it was actually the perfect size to share between two.

You can find this charming restaurant on Degraves Street which is just a two minute walk away from Flinders Street Station."
Melbourne,cafe,The Quarter,ChIJzRa1FbRC1moR01tSbLByQ8s,"27-31 Degraves St, Melbourne",4.3,Rhys G,"Beautiful cafe, well designed. The atmosphere is perfect. The staff and their attention to their customers is exceptional and the food is 10/10. I highly recommend the ""Quarter Eggs Benny"". The pulled pork is exceptional."
Melbourne,cafe,The Quarter,ChIJzRa1FbRC1moR01tSbLByQ8s,"27-31 Degraves St, Melbourne",4.3,Vivian William,The chorizo omelette was delicious. Eggs benedict was also very unique and tasty. Coffee was nice. Good little cafe for brunch.
Melbourne,cafe,Manchester Press,ChIJg1wLO7VC1moRrzObM92WgkU,"8 Rankins Ln, Melbourne",4.3,Amy (thehungrymelbgirl),"Nestled deep inside Rankins Ln, Manchester Press draws a consistent crowd with its bagels and warehouse vibes.

The last time I dined here was 7 years ago. The chorizo bagel I had back then was well put together and very tasty. The lack of customer service was, however, quite off-putting.

We recently tried Manchester Press again, and we can't fault the warm staff at all. Unfortunately, it was the food that didn't quite hit the mark this time.

We ordered the Bacon and Maple Bagel ($24.50), which on paper sounds like the perfect combination of sweet and savoury. However, it was actually quite difficult to get all the flavours together as it was quite textural. We also weren't sure whether the blueberry bagel was the best flavour to compliment this creation.

We fared a bit better with the Philly Steak Bagel ($23.80), although the chef may have gone a bit overboard with the chipotle mayo and the overall result was not that aesthetically pleasing.

Hojicha Latte ($6.50) is on its current special menu for those wanting to try something different.

It was overall a slightly underwhelming experience, but I am hoping it was only because we went on a bad day..."
Melbourne,cafe,Manchester Press,ChIJg1wLO7VC1moRrzObM92WgkU,"8 Rankins Ln, Melbourne",4.3,Pauline,"It‚Äôs been many years since I visited Manchester Press.

ü•Øü´ê I‚Äôve had very fond memories of their blueberry bagel served with the best mascarpone cream mixed with berries and pistachio, so I decided to visit them again after at least 5 years. It most definitely did not disappoint even though the way they whip the cream is now a little different.

I highly recommend the mixed berry bagel if you want a sweet brunch.

üç≥ We also had their Egg Benedict and it was superb with a generous serving of bacon.

üçØ Another bagel we tried was their honey ricotta toast, I would have preferred they served a bigger portion of ricotta rather than thinly spread it on the bagel. I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying more for it too. I suppose this highlights the bagel rather than the topping."
Melbourne,cafe,Manchester Press,ChIJg1wLO7VC1moRrzObM92WgkU,"8 Rankins Ln, Melbourne",4.3,Emily Holm,"This place used to be one of the *it* places in Melbourne. And now‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs fine?
Our coffee was still pretty good actually. But our bagels didn‚Äôt look or taste nearly as exciting and they used to.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶ they were absolutely fine. Just nothing special. The smoked salmon looks unhappy and tasted like supermarket salmon, and the blueberries were sparing.
There was nothing super wrong, but also nothing super right."
Melbourne,cafe,Manchester Press,ChIJg1wLO7VC1moRrzObM92WgkU,"8 Rankins Ln, Melbourne",4.3,Ariaan,Service and atmosphere is amazing here! Staff is always so friendly and it‚Äôs so cozy inside. I ordered an oat mocha and ham and cheese toasted sandwich takeaway. Oat mocha tasted bland and watery. Toasted sandwich was crunchy and buttery however there wasn‚Äôt a lot of cheese and the ham was very salty. The other sandwiches on their menu look amazing though so definitely recommend trying one of those instead! Bagels looked delicious!
Melbourne,cafe,Manchester Press,ChIJg1wLO7VC1moRrzObM92WgkU,"8 Rankins Ln, Melbourne",4.3,Cindy Ramli Chang,"Brunch date with the one and only on our wedding anniversary day ‚ù§Ô∏è
That day I decided that I do not like bagels ü§£
The sandwich was beautiful
Bagels topping was good but I just figured that I do not like that texture. So dense ü§£
But apparently ‚ÄúGood bagels are denser than most bread,‚Äù
Well guess I just don‚Äôt like it üôà

The place was buzzing with people enjoying their food. Young, old, kids, adult, they all enjoying the vibes there.
Will come back for more sandwiches üòÅ

Melbourne,cafe,Rich√© - Cafe Richmond,ChIJ3cZApzdD1moRFvz4e0vlik8,"3/189 Bridge Rd, Richmond",4.8,Tolga O,"We had a fantastic experience at Riche, and highly recommend it. The menu has plenty of creative options that let it stand out from your generic local cafe. The food is well, portioned and tastes great.
The atmosphere is energetic, so I'd highly recommend a booking if coming on the weekend.
My partner had the pumpkin king, and along with my Riche burger, we enjoyed both meals and left full.
On the drinks side we enjoyed a black sesame latte (surprisingly enjoyable), and a berry smoothie (tasted healthy and light).
We'd definitely come again."
Melbourne,cafe,Rich√© - Cafe Richmond,ChIJ3cZApzdD1moRFvz4e0vlik8,"3/189 Bridge Rd, Richmond",4.8,Ivan Lu,"I visited Rich√© Cafe on a weekday morning, and it was moderately busy. I ordered a soy latte, which had nice latte art and tasted great. However, I also tried the Prawny Business dish. Unfortunately, there were only 3-4 small shrimp, and they were a bit overcooked and dry, almost like they had been pre-cooked and then re-fried. On a positive note, the service was excellent; the staff checked in on me several times to ensure everything was okay. Overall, it was a mixed experience."
Melbourne,cafe,Rich√© - Cafe Richmond,ChIJ3cZApzdD1moRFvz4e0vlik8,"3/189 Bridge Rd, Richmond",4.8,Nana Pun,"This restaurant is one of the best brunch places I‚Äôve ever visited. We must go again; the food is incredibly delicious with a fusion design that offers a fresh take on classic dishes. The bread, French toast, and pumpkin base are all wonderfully soft, and the seasoning enhances every flavor. Words can‚Äôt fully describe how much we enjoyed the whole experience. Highly recommended!"

The speed of deliver is also something I must mention, all the dishes we ordered come out in around 10-15 min, despite the cafe being relatively lively at the time.

The price was definitely reasonable as well. So deffs worth a try or making this place a regular spot if you live close by!"
Melbourne,cafe,Rich√© - Cafe Richmond,ChIJ3cZApzdD1moRFvz4e0vlik8,"3/189 Bridge Rd, Richmond",4.8,Matt,"Food was OK, but nothing special. You can find a better burger almost anywhere, but the chips were good. Long black and curry laksa also nice but quite average."

Each bite of the steak is tender, juicy, and perfectly grilled, with a delicious flavor. The prawn salad is refreshing and delicious, with fresh prawn complemented by crisp lettuce and salad dressing, bringing a refreshing seafood flavor. As for the garlic cheese bread, it's a wonderful combination, with a soft texture and a surface sprinkled with rich cheese and garlic flavor, each bite is a delight. Overall, this meal is satisfying and a feast for the taste buds."

I ordered the bacon eggs benedict, and the eggs were too sour. Is this really bacon? There wasn't even a hash brown! The place felt busy but didn't deliver on quality. I won't be coming back"

We've been here a few times now.
Food is always good and coffee is to our liking.

They have a kids menu which is always a bit plus.
They also sell candy which is fun for the kids.

I just wish this place is warmer in the winters and cooler in the summer but that is just a minor thing.

We will be back. Definitely the best cafe in the knox area!"

Menu had lots of favourites and some items with a fun twist! Our food was well presented and delicious and we predominantly enjoyed our meals...The green hashbrown dish was yummy ( but came served with a hair and the fritters were cold inside)
We did have difficulties making our reservation ( getting someone to answer the phone took 5 tries over 2 days)"

I ordered the golden latte with tumeric, almond milk and cinnamon. It had such a rich and spicy flavour, highly recommend.

The staff were very attentive and friendly üôè"
Melbourne,cafe,Cafe Court,ChIJp3us-bhd1moRVQACsirqS2Y,"536 Lonsdale St, Melbourne",4.6,Debajyoti Saha,Went for brunch on a Sunday morning and this place surprised us with the amazing food and the beverages. The place is nice and cozy with good decors. We ordered some freshly squeezed juice and an iced mocha and both were really good. For food we ordered the traditional Benedict and Chilli Scrambled eggs. Both the dishes looked visually pleasing and the taste was even better. Would highly recommend this place for brunch!

The food was delicious, I had the brisket bun, tried my brother‚Äôs omelette, others had poached eggs, bowl of chips, smashed avocado, and the double cheeseburger.
The service was really great, professional friendly flexible and accommodating. We had a really lovely catch up and will definitely be returning when in Melbourne again."

The pancakes were absolutely delicious and not too sweet, I highly recommend!  My partner had their original omelette and said it was good but needed a little more flavor.

Melbourne,cafe,Cafe Court,ChIJp3us-bhd1moRVQACsirqS2Y,"536 Lonsdale St, Melbourne",4.6,Jasmine Drake,"Cool unique decor and plenty of seating. Nice and open plan. Service is impeccable. Staff noticed we only had one menu and gave us another without us even asking. They brought cutlery to our table and the food came out hot fresh and quick. Flavours of the chorizo, mushrooms and relish are amazing in the big brekkie. Nice hollandaise sauce on the Benedict.  Poached eggs to perfection. Coffee is very strong. They can do iced lattes even though its not on the menu, they have flavored syrups but they are quite weak so would reccomend extra if you prefer more sweetness"

The staff here are very friendly and helpful. Not forgetting to mention, coffee and food are above my expectations. Ordered the Eggs on Toast and Chicken burger. And they tasted so good. Love it and will definitely be back again"
Melbourne,cafe,CIEL Cafe,ChIJp_40rPhn1moRsKphY_EJRRA,"48 Cecil St, Southbank",4.7,Tobi Jacobs,"**Review for Ciel Cafe, Southbank**

I recently had the pleasure of enjoying breakfast at **Ciel Cafe** in Southbank, and it was an experience worth raving about! Nestled in a spacious ground floor location, this cafe truly is a hidden gem in the local area.

I opted for the **Breakfast Burger**, which was an absolute delight. The burger featured a perfectly cooked egg with a runny yolk, pork and fennel sausage, bacon onion, and coffee jam, sauerkraut , ripe house burger sauce and swiss cheese, all sandwiched between glossy milk buns. Each bite was a burst of flavor, and the ingredients were clearly fresh and of high quality. The burger was priced at a reasonable $20

To complement the burger, I ordered a side of their **homemade hash browns**. These golden-brown delights were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, making them the perfect accompaniment. The side of three hash browns cost **$6**.

To top it all off, I enjoyed a large **Cappuccino** with intricate latte art. The coffee was rich and smooth, providing the perfect start to my day. The cappuccino was priced at **$5**.

What truly set this experience apart was the **extremely friendly and welcoming service** by the staff. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and attentive service. The staff made sure I felt right at home and were more than happy to accommodate any requests.

The cafe itself boasts a modern and stylish design with large windows that allow natural light to flood the space, creating a bright and welcoming atmosphere. The decor is minimalist, with clean lines and neutral colors, giving the space a sophisticated and elegant feel.

Overall, Ciel Cafe in Southbank is a must-visit for anyone looking for a delicious breakfast in a welcoming and stylish setting. I can't wait to return and try more of their offerings!"

The place also has a super cute vibe, perfect for relaxing or catching up with friends. Definitely a place I would come back to again and again. Highly recommended!"
Melbourne,cafe,CIEL Cafe,ChIJp_40rPhn1moRsKphY_EJRRA,"48 Cecil St, Southbank",4.7,Graeldon,"Hidden Gem!
The food and drinks here are fantastic and really reasonably priced - I'm super happy that I stumbled upon this place, and it deserves being 10 times busier.
The food came out pretty quickly, and I was impressed by the quality. The potato served with the eggs benedict was crispy on the outside but fluffy and creamy on the inside. The bacon was high quality, and the eggs were just right.
I also tried the breakfast roti 2.0, and the roti was better than I've had in some Indian restaurants. The pork belly was quite fatty but full of flavour and well balanced by the pickled veg.
Both dishes were really thoughtful and balanced, and I felt like the chef(s) really care about the quality of the dishes they create.

I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, it was simply fantastic.
Thank you CIEL Cafe!"

We ordered the classic bacon sandwich, the roasted chicken sandwich, and mocha. The mocha was quite good, and the chicken sandwich was perfectly prepared and tasted fantastic.

I went for brunch with my friends, and when we arrived at the restaurant, we were treated with contempt. However, the group behind us was clearly given preferential treatment, which is not how I have been treated at other places I've visited here. Based on my personal experience, I would not recommend this place if you are not a local in the area."

There was a mountain of kale...I like kale but couldn't get through half of it. Hubby enjoyed the French toast, not so much the coffee. The coffee was not to my liking at all, but exchanged for tea that was fine. When paying the bill realised they charge the tax on top, so another $7. A pleasant cafe"

The flat white and long black tasted great.

The atmosphere is a highlight of this establishment. Despite being cold outside, it was cozy, low light ambience and beautiful decor inside.

The serving staff were stressed and looked overworked due to the volume of customers coming in. More front staff would benefit this place, as it took a while to clean tables despite people waiting and also once seated it look a while for staff to take orders."

It's hidden behind a wooden door, and when you open the door, it's a factory style, very spacious, very beautiful, and a very unique decoration atmosphere!! The key is that the food is really good, and my favorite two dishes are in those picture that I post!!

We randomly selected this cafe for lunch and we were not disappointed. Their service was excellent with all the staff being very nice and were taking orders in spite of being very busy. We loved all the dishes we ordered and the outstanding was the French toast. The kids chicken fingers with chips had only two pieces of chicken which we found to be very less. Otherwise the taste was awesome. We would definitely visit this cafe again.

I got the Beef Ribs Benedict and my boyfriend got the Billy Burger.
My dish was absolutely delicious (I‚Äôve gotten it before so I knew it was good haha) and my boyfriend‚Äôs was good. The burger patty was a bit overcooked, and there weren‚Äôt any onion rings even when the menu said there was. But it wasn‚Äôt horrible, so we didn‚Äôt raise the issue to the waitressses.
Other than that, it was quite a lovely brunch."

With numerous outdoor seatings available on the side of Acland st, this place would be great for drinking on a nice day. The kids spaghetti had mince meat which we appreciated but a little bland. The schnitzel is crispy and the gravy sauce is pretty good. The chili burger was disappointing, the buns and the patties are dry and not much flavour overall so it just tasted meaty with jalapenos in every few bites.

The staff were super friendly and helpful sharing menu suggestions and taking an interest in our experience.

The decor was chic and intriguing, with little spaces of different character here and there.

As it was such a beautiful day, we sat outside to take advantage of it.

The breakfast and lunch menus were extensive and appetising. My beautiful wife had the prawn salad and I had the pork ribs. The food arrived very quickly and it was perfectly prepared and presents. My chips, onion rings and ribs were flavoursome, with the pork falling off the bone. Often, you end up wearing the rib sauce, but not this time. My wife‚Äôs salad was richly textured, with halloumi, roasted macadamia nuts and an avocado all included.

My dirty chai latte was exquisite.

We had the smashed avo and it was delicious, my only let down was there could have been a little more feta, we only got 2 small cubes.

Coffee was great too.

We'll definitely come back when we're in Melbourne next"

Menu is fairly simple with only the regular breakfast dishes, but food is tasty, pricing is good and effort has gone into it's presentation. I also like the coffee artwork and messages written on hot drinks. Metal seats are a bit uncomfortable, but there are options for indoor or outdoor dining."

If I had to pick a favourite, I loved the baked eggs casserole, very tasty. But honestly I enjoyed them all and I highly recommend you try them for yourself.
My favourite winter drink, the spiced hot chocolate, so good!!"
Melbourne,cafe,Cafe La Colline,ChIJUZU4siNo1moRpWbPENB9ICc,"3/13 Commercial Rd, Melbourne",4.2,Bobzbellycious,"A long established cafe with a fresh a breath of new management beside the Alfred hospital.

We had:
üêΩPulled Pork Egg Benny
üêîChicken Parmagiana
üíñRhubarb Cheesecake
üç´Spiced (hot) Chocolate
üçìStrawberry-Rhubarb Smoothie

I loved  the slightly charred and smokiness of the pulled pork.
The chicken parma perhaps could use less salt as it already got saltiness from the ham and the cheese.

The highlight of my visit there was definitely their Rhubarb Cheesecakeüòç Such a delicious cheesecake with all three layers from the top to bottom are complementing each other. Yummy.

Their winter special Spiced Hot Chocolate also took me by surprise. I don‚Äôt usually go for spiced drinks, but I enjoyed the spiced hot chocolate at this cafe. It was just such comforting drink. Perfect drink for Melbourne‚Äôs freezing winter!

Their smoothie was a bit too heavy for my liking. Also could use a but more sweetness.

Overall enjoyable brunch experience at this local‚Äôs favourite cafeü•∞"

Melbourne,cafe,Cafe La Colline,ChIJUZU4siNo1moRpWbPENB9ICc,"3/13 Commercial Rd, Melbourne",4.2,ADITI SAHA,"The best, very fresh and tasty brunch menu @lacollinecafe in Melbourne will keep you coming back to this cafe again and again.

And the new menu recipe developer @lifewithriya__ did a fantastic job by incorporating simple yet satisfying flavours into every dish to make a beautiful gastronomic experience for the foodies.

What we had and all these are must try tbh:

Superfood smoothie bowl, it‚Äôs very healthy with all the granola and avocado smoothie and berries in it. Has a strong avo taste to it, but it‚Äôs really tasteful.

Dulche de leche waffles, the best part about this sweet dish is that it‚Äôs extremely balanced with a bit of salty and sweet flavour to it. The crispiness of waffles are next level.

Halloumi burger with sweet potato fries, the halloumi is of great quality and that burger filling sauce is so special and addictive that you don‚Äôt wanna share this dish with anyone.

Veggies stack, so mind blowing creation, this was my absolute favourite with deep fried fritters melting in my mouth and oh that beetroot relish, radish and feta makes the entire dish so immensely yum. Strongly recommended

Supreme Avo toast, not your usual avo toast, but with simple flavours with a hint of red radish in balsamic makes this dish unique and super tasty.

Meatball casserole, comforting, cheesy, delectable meatballs in a flavourful bolognese sauce with basil, served with garlic bread.

The coffee here already has a reputation of being the best in the area, and their barista @tannie_le can make your day by doing the cutest latte art.

So guys as you can see, I‚Äôm super impressed by the fact that a small little cafe like @lacollinecafe serves the most healthy, delicious and amazing brunch/breakfast on the go, coffee and smoothies in Melbourne. Yes this cafe definitely falls under the category of best hidden gem cafe in the city. Visit today guys!"

This hidden gem in South Melbourne by far offers some superior level coffee and food. I absolutely adored my squid ink risotto and my son‚Äôs pancake was something! Beautiful and fresh. Hubby enjoyed the dirty eggs. The staff were really friendly and super accomodating to our son/his pram (he‚Äôs disabled and unable to walk) Parking is available on street and timed. We will definitely be back. Thank you for such a great experience.
Melbourne,cafe,ST. ALi Coffee Roasters - South Melbourne,ChIJJ5bS6P9n1moRx76U3LjtN1A,"12-18 Yarra Pl, South Melbourne",4.2,Katie Goldberg,"St Ali used to be my go-to brunch spot, and I frequently brought out-of-town friends here. I was excited to try their new menu, but unfortunately, it was a major letdown. Most of the dishes are now centered around eggs, which wasn‚Äôt appealing to me, so I opted for the avocado toast.

As you can see from the photos, the bread was burned and bitter, and the avocado was also charred (unsure what the chef is thinking, as the charred flavour needs careful balancing which just isn‚Äôt there for this dish). There was no seasoning aside from dukkah (despite the menu promising some hummus), which was overpowering and made the entire dish overwhelmingly bitter. I struggled to eat it.

To add some flavour, I ordered extras‚Äîa hash brown for $7 and halloumi for $8‚Äîbut even with those additions, the dish still came to a steep $37 for a flavor combination that was not balanced and something I absolutely hated. Easily one of the worst brunch experiences I‚Äôve had, especially in a city with so many better options.

On top of that, the service was seriously lacking. The older gentleman at the front was extremely dismissive when we arrived, even though we had a booking for that time. He just told us to wait outside, in the pouring rain, without any care or effort to acknowledge us. As a food blogger, I go out a lot, and the service can either make or break your experience - with this experience being the latter. Sadly, St Ali seems to have forgotten that in their pursuit of $$$.

To make matters worse, our table was broken and kept rocking the entire meal, which only added to the frustration. Sadly, I won‚Äôt be coming back again, which is a shame because their coffee is still amazing."

My partner and I are from Sydney and use this place as the gold standard when trying new cafes. When we last visited in June we both opted for the Dirty Eggs and a few months later now we still bring up how good this breakfast was. The entire staff have a deep respect and love for what they do and it‚Äôs downright beautiful to witness, we can‚Äôt  wait to visit again very soon!"

Congee - while the kid liked it as is (with XO/ chilli) we adults preferred it with more spice and kick. Second time round, there wasn‚Äôt (enough) chili oil, kid needed to request for more :)

Hummus Breakfast: crispy chickpeas were a nice touch to the entire dish with a different texture. Curry leaves too elevated the dish

Naan dish - was great, mopped up everything with the naan

Chill scrambled - taste was a bit flat in my opinion - lot more spice would‚Äôve really made the chili ‚Äúchili‚Äù

Dirty eggs - didn‚Äôt feel like it was a favourite to me as it was too tomatoey but I reckon a passata lover would be delighted!"

On a cold winter morning, we saw the warm cauldrons of soup in the front of the store. $15 for a large bowl and bread was great!

The pumpkin and the potato soup was delicious. Also the generous portion of the soup was a highlight.

The bread served together was perfectly toasted and the garlic butter on top was perfect to dip into the soup.

It was pleasant to sit and watch the people wander through the alleyway!

Would recommend for those traveling like we were!"

Melbourne,cafe,Cafe Issus,ChIJqe5RObRC1moR8XdnjeOXV8Q,"8 Centre Pl, Melbourne",4.2,Kat,"Hidden little gem! My son is an ADF applicant and we were on our way for his medical exam. Being 2 hours early and from the outer eastern suburbs, we wanted breakfast.

I won't pretend that we knew where we were going because a beautiful soul realised after I inadvertently invaded her space. (She was sweeping around her things and I apologised profusely.)

She asked if we were lost as I got my phone out and explained rather pathetically why I pulled over and didn't mean to interrupt her day. She knew exactly where the best spot to head to for breakfast. This assertive, independent, full of passionate strength and determination was completely patient when she realised I was hearing impaired and my adult son was with me. She made a stop at one shop, didn't like the behaviour of staff then took us straight to Issus Cafe. She insisted we sit in the back corner, told the staff to look after us and didn't leave until she was confident we were good.

Cafe Issus did not disappoint!! Lovely staff, great atmosphere, and we were very pleased.

So much so, we returned on another day for another ADF appointment.

I asked the lady of the house if she knew who I was talking about and she does. I asked if she could thank her because we weren't able to catch up after breakfast and was told this lovely lady comes by often and she will get our thanks to her when she comes in for soup.

Thankyou so much for the opportunity to send our thanks and our yummy breakfast!"

I ordered a small latte and a hashbrown wrap, and they both came pretty quickly. Admittedly, the latte tasted pretty weak, then again, I am used to stronger coffees. The hashbrown wrap, however, has the very right balance of flavours, the thick slice of eggs, the hash potatoes, the bacon, and the thin layer of barbecue sauce woke my stomach up very well.

Both items came together around AUD12, it was a nice start of the morning"

The place was almost 30% full and still the waitress went to check if she can fit 4 of us, lol. However apart from that the service was the best part of our visit of all the things. Coffee was average, food was bad, the look wasn‚Äôt too bad but had no taste, the toast was not toasted, was at least two days old (on a public holiday which meant to be busy and fresh ingredients, i doubt so) the scrambled egg was so over cooked, i can keep writing about how bad it was for our brunch!!! We ordered some breaky cocktails which we felt it was a ripped. The heirloon breakfast was some raw tomato on an old slice of toast with nothing else. My plate came with some running oil everywhere

This is probably not the best venue to choose - however it was the only place we could get a table for brunch without a wait.

1. The staff were AMAZING!  I needed to request a different table as where we were seated was way to loud/being/overwhelming.
tip: sit in the front of the cafe where all the plants are.  It's a bit quieter and not as bright.
2. Our waitress was really helpful and I appreciated her coming back just to check in and make sure we were ok.
3. The menu is glossy and shiny and overwhelming!!! If you get stuch there's a specials insert in the front cover that's easier to take in.  I thoroughly recommend the Korean Fried Chicken Burger.

Food was delicious"

After a total wait time of 60 minutes we finally got a table and were escorted away from the tiny waiting area (which is where everyone enters and exits from).

We were served relatively quickly and my partner and I both ordered the Turkish eggs, one of our favourite dishes we regularly get from other cafes local to us.

The food came out after about 20 minutes which wasn‚Äôt too bad considering how busy it was.

We paid around $30 dollars per meal for 2 eggs, overcooked bread, 4 under cooked cherry tomatoes, chilli oil and a watery yogurt, served with a knife and fork that couldn‚Äôt scoop up the watery mess that sat at the bottom of our bowl. This is arguably one of the worst meals I‚Äôve paid for in my life.

The only thing missing in the photo I‚Äôve attached, is 1 piece of halloumi, 2 eggs and 1 small tomato. $30 for that?!?! It honestly made me feel sick paying for a meal that was served like this. I left feeling more hungry than I did when I entered."

Here‚Äôs what we had:

Belly Benny ‚Äì Slow-cooked pork belly on a crispy waffle, with poached eggs and homemade hollandaise. The pork was tender, and the waffle taste caramelized, with a crunchy yet soft texture.

Thai Calamari Salad ‚Äì Crispy on the outside and tender inside. It came with lots of fresh vegetables and Thai chili sauce, giving it a tangy, spicy kick. The salad also had rice noodles, which made it more filling.

Bao Bao ‚Äì Three baos with tender slow-cooked pork belly, cucumber, and pickled carrots. The sweet and sour flavors worked well together, and the pork was rich but not too greasy. We were four people, so they added an extra bao for us. The soft, fluffy buns were very satisfying. It seems this dish might be changing on next week‚Äôs new menu though.

Crispy Fried Korean Chicken Burger ‚Äì My friend‚Äôs choice, and they enjoyed it. The chicken was crispy on the outside, paired with Korean BBQ sauce and a good portion of fries.

Smoothies ‚Äì We tried both the mango and banana smoothies, with less ice for a creamier texture. They were both full of flavor, with a rich milkiness and fresh fruit taste."

The staff were very friendly and attentive and the waiting time for food was reasonable . The coffees were served well, although they lacked design on the foam. The French toast was unreal, rich berry/jammy taste with delicious ice cream on top.

Waitress cleared table but didn't bother wiping. The cafe was well staffed and not particularly busy so no excuse. Turkish Golzeme and Burek were somewhat lean on filling.

From the unsatisfactory hygiene of the middle-aged woman handling the food to various instances of unsafe actions like touching clothes and handling food without proper sanitation, my expresses disappointment and suggests significant hygiene issues at the establishment.

I ordered two cups of coffee, a Salmon bagel and a vegetable egg scramble from this restaurant!
While waiting for the food, I got to see the hygiene concept of the staff and was devastated by their actions!
The hygiene of the restaurant industry of a middle-aged woman in charge of my food was so abysmal!
My order food was on the bench
Wearing gloves, she went out toward the outdoor table!
She cleaned herself up by touching her clothes with that hand , Then brought a coffee cup for takeout from outside, threw it away in the kitchen, and started touching my order food without washing her hands or changing her gloves
Waiting for the veggie egg scrumble, she applied the margarine of bread then touched and held the oven door handle, picked up the bread and put it in the oven. As she went to the kitchen, she touched her head again, and when a short-haired woman in the kitchen brought an egg scramble to a frying pan, she held on to the oven door handle again and talked to a short-haired woman without a mask
While she never changed gloves or wash her hands!!!!!

They put the food in a square tray without a lid and hand it to me, saying it's a takeaway food! It's a hygienic food that I can't really eat if I really know it!!

Please People in the restaurant industry want to be more hygienic, especially at this times!!"

I prefer more chocolate in my hot chocolate; it was quite a small amount, but I still loved it. The carrot cake had a very nice lemon frosting. As for the toastie, its salad could have used some sort of dressing. Despite these comments, I can definitely say I will go there again. The staff are good, and it's a very nice place for taking photos as well!

Melbourne,cafe,Secret Grounds Cafe Doncaster,ChIJlVqp27BH1moR1k2r-8gqUAA,"87 High St, Doncaster",4.5,Vic H,"I recently visited Secret Ground in Doncaster and had a delightful experience.

The atmosphere is fantastic, with minimalist decor and a white colour theme that feels fresh and inviting without being clinical.

The staff were exceptionally friendly and highly knowledgeable about the menu, reassuring us that our meals would be gluten-free.

I started my lunch with an almond latte. The coffee, made with beans from Industry Bean, tasted excellent and had a smooth flavour without any bitterness.

For my meal, I ordered the mushroom omelette and opted for the gluten-free option. I was pleasantly surprised to receive two slices of bread, as most cafes usually only provide one. The portion size was generous, leaving me feeling very satisfied.

One minor downside is the parking situation. There's a 30-minute to 2-hour parking limit, and spaces can be limited, so it's best to arrive early.

Also, I highly recommend making a reservation since the place is quite popular, and booking a table in advance can save you from disappointment.

I also noticed that Secret Ground is child-friendly, with several parents bringing their infants and toddlers. I've already recommended this cafe to my sister, who plans to visit with her friend in the coming weeks.

Overall, Secret Ground is a wonderful spot for great coffee and delicious food."

During my first visit, I was disappointed with a cold coffee, and the staff's response to my request for a replacement was unprofessional.

On my second visit, I hoped for a better experience while doing research. Unfortunately, my coffee was again served lukewarm and had a burned taste. After 40 minutes, staff approached me multiple times, and eventually placed a reservation sign on my table, despite many empty seats. This felt disrespectful, especially since I had communicated my intent to stay longer.

I suggest clearly indicating time limits for table use to avoid inconveniencing customers. Overall, the atmosphere and service did not meet expectations."

The thoughtfully arranged seating areas create an atmosphere that is both calming and conducive to focus. One of the standout features of Little Bang Espresso is the staff. They are not only friendly and approachable but also exuded a genuine warmth.

The efficiency of service here is commendable. Despite the steady stream of students and staff stopping by for their caffeine fix, drinks are prepared speedily without compromising on quality. Whether you're in between classes or on a quick break from work, with drinks made with such efficiency, you won‚Äôt have to wait long to savour your beverage.

The menu boasts a wide range of beverages, from classic hot drinks to refreshing juices, catering to every preference. On my recent visit, I opted for a chai latte, and I was very impressed. The warmth of the drink made it a comforting choice on a chilly day.

Complementing their drink menu is an impressive selection of pastries. These treats pair wonderfully with any of their drinks and are a great option for a light snack or indulgent treat. During my visit, we found a cosy corner table that became the perfect spot to unwind.

We ordered honey lamb sausages with halloumi, sweet potato hash (not the typical hash) and fresh spinach. It was delicious and flavoursome. The portion is perfect, and the price is reasonable.

This cafe has a great atmosphere, especially with plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.

The staff are friendly and helpful. This eatery has plenty of seating, is spacious, kid-friendly, clean and great with the locals.

It has 2 hour Street parking on the main road so it's plenty to find parking."

I wish they would change their opening hours till longer. Heaters outside in winters & pet friendliness, outdoor as well as indoor seating makes this place more better.Saw some new faces in the cafe recently they were all polite,welcoming & kind.I would definitely recommend 5/5"

This is a small shop in size, but it was buzzing with busy customers buying a caffeine hit. We ordered a coffee (Colombian type of bean) and an iced latte.

The staff were super friendly and even offered us to try a special type of brew without us asking! Coffee is definitely subjective, but we enjoyed our drinks on top of the great customer service. Would recommend a visit for coffee lovers!"

Read many good reviews so I  decided to have brunch  here. Enjoyed the coffee most, followed by the cozy ambience. Food is decent but rather pricey, in line iwith everywhere else in Melbourne.  The owner rounded off my bill.  What a nice gesture. üòÄ"
Melbourne,cafe,The Journal Cafe,ChIJ4bzpPbRC1moRptcDLM1Km_0,"253 Flinders Ln, Melbourne",4.1,Anneliese,"Stumbled across this cafe when I was looking for a nearby cafe that was fully packed with the weekend rush. It‚Äôs quite intimate inside with a library style decor. The menu is small however they have a nice mix of sweet and savoury dishes. I had poached eggs on toast and asked for crumpets as my bread. This was very yummy and filling. I also had a soy latte that was nice, I just wish the coffee blend was slightly stronger.

Do be conscious of the 15% surcharge on Sundays which does raise the price of your meal."

It is an institution in the cbd of Melbourne and always has a nice vibe of MELBOURNians enjoying the space.

I love the big communal table and the morning newspapers for everyone to enjoy.

The tuna nicoise salad is a very healthy and nourishing meal which is a huge bonus amongst cafes in the area that tend to only do pastries and eggs based dishes.

I also love the different seating options available from the couch option to the communal table to a table of two or four.

The service is friendly and impeccable which is also not so easy to come by in my experience.

Savour the experience at the Journal cafe."
Melbourne,cafe,The Journal Cafe,ChIJ4bzpPbRC1moRptcDLM1Km_0,"253 Flinders Ln, Melbourne",4.1,Nick Chatz,"Full disclosure, went during April of this year - menu and misc may have changed.

The service was kind, and there were some interesting options to choose on the menu, coffee was good quality and well made.

Unfortunately service was slow, around 45 minutes between ordering and receiving food, so make sure to bring friends. Chairs are almost entirely stools, very uncomfortable and could probably do with replacing.

We ordered Croque Monsieurs and they were alright, very expensive for what they were and we would likely make a different choice when ordering, pickes and mustard were good.

Stiff competition in the city, keep working at it Journal Cafe."

I've had people in the area recommend the coffee, but when I ordered with a keep cup, they didn't fill it all the way up.

I asked for a stronger coffee with the expectation they'd full it up all the way, and as a result, it was too strong to drink. It was too busy to bother. I visited later in the afternoon the week earlier and went back and asked them to fill the cup all the way. Which is when I discovered that they didn't give me enough shots for the size of the cup."

As for the food, we ordered two dishes - the Mushroom Medley was truly delicious and was a big filling, portion as it comes eggs and halloumi.

The Vegetarian Paella with Eggs was a big downer for us in terms of flavour and texture both. It was quite bland compared to all the times I‚Äôve had a paella, and the rice was overcooked to a point it was mushy."

As a well-known coffee shop in the city, I expected above-average service. When we walked in, the barista, who was also handling the counter, rudely asked us to wait. Although we were not in a rush and waited patiently, she didn't make eye contact or greet us kindly when it was our turn to order. The store wasn‚Äôt busy, and while she seemed friendly with her co-worker, her attitude towards us, as customers, was unacceptable. This negatively impacted my coffee experience and the taste of my latte. Bad service and a bad impression of Industry Beans, which is supposed to be a must-try coffee spot. üò¢"

Melbourne,tea house,Oriental Teahouse Melbourne CBD,ChIJd5kNx7RC1moR-pM_GKr9bKQ,"378 Little Collins St, Melbourne",4.3,Jojo Kat,"I recently visited this restaurant and overall, the service was good. It seems to be quite popular among nearby office workers, which is always a good sign!

For lunch, we ordered a variety of dishes, including the AUTHENTIC PRAWN DUMPLINGS, PORK & PRAWN SHU MAI, XO SCALLOP & PRAWN DUMPLINGS, XIAO LONG BAO, CHINESE CABBAGE PORK DUMPLINGS, and BLACK BEAN BARRAMUNDI FILLET. Most of the dim sums were quite enjoyable, although I found the Xiao Long Bao to be less juicy than expected.

However, I was a bit disappointed with the BLACK BEAN BARRAMUNDI FILLET ‚Äì it was quite salty, and the fish was quite tough. The black bean sauce overwhelmed the other flavors, which was a letdown.

For dessert, we tried the CHINESE WONKA DUMPLINGS and COCONUT & OSMANTHUS JELLY. I absolutely loved the CHINESE WONKA DUMPLINGS! The sesame-covered shell was crispy, and the rich chocolate filling was not overly sweet ‚Äì just perfect!

Overall, it's a decent place to satisfy your dim sum cravings. Would recommend for the experience!"
Melbourne,tea house,Oriental Teahouse Melbourne CBD,ChIJd5kNx7RC1moR-pM_GKr9bKQ,"378 Little Collins St, Melbourne",4.3,Pavinee Gaffney,"We had a company team meeting lunch here. As the group is bigger than 8+, we had to order a feed me menu which we were okay with at the start. The options on the menu are slightly limited and you can't choose whatever you want on the list. We opted to go with 8 dishes and the option we have to select 2 items from the stream section and the deep fry, 3 items from the main and one dessert. None of us eat Asian dessert so we asked to swap it with something else and you can only pick from the stream section to replace dessert. You can't just choose dumplings and Dim Sim for all 8 dishes.
As we had all the food details sorted before the day, we were expected a little quicker service than we received. They especially advertise the feed me as unlimited feed that can reorder as much as you can eat in 90 minutes (8 dishes for $56 per person). The first set of stream and fried dishes didn't get to the table until 22 minutes after we seated. Then when we finished all the stream and fry dishes and tried to order a couple more dishes, we were then told we can't reorder anything until all the dishes on the lists have arrived. All the mains and the rest of the dishes arrived at the table after 45 minutes. The staff took some reorder items then. Not all of group like eating the same things so we all reorder want we want to eat and the item I reorder which is a prawn and shallots wonton didn't arrive until 70 minutes into the seating time.
All the reorder dishes also go down in size, for example, the veggies spring roll has 6 pieces in the first serve, but only 4 in the second serve so when we thought one serve will be enough but then some people had to miss out.
To finish it off, they still manage to put through wrong charges of 10 dishes at $68 per person at the start after spending 5 minutes going through the 8 dishes to confirm our order.
Overall very disappointed with the group booking and foods."

We also ordered a beef dish, some appetisers, and white chocolate dumplings for dessert. The appetisers came out quickly, but the main dishes took an excessive amount of time‚Äîaround 35 to 40 minutes each, which really slowed down the meal. Unfortunately, this happened with every new dish we ordered, leading to a dinner that lasted over two and a half hours. While the food was solid, the poor service really overshadowed the experience, and I wouldn‚Äôt be in a rush to return."

The steamed buns and dumplings weren‚Äôt the best so don‚Äôt expect a full yumcha experience here, but dumplings are dumplings. The stir fry, fried rice and the noodles were great. Love the drink menu rotation especially the traditional festival inspired/limited drinks. The dessert wasn‚Äôt its strongest suit but the mains definitely make up for it.

They currently invite customers to have a free lucky draw upon entry. I got a ‚ÄúSi ji chun Oolong‚Äù with a warm blessing ‚ÄúWishes granted‚Äù. The staff invited me to experience the process of tea brewing, explained the tones and benefits of oolong, and let me enjoy the tea with elegant tea set.
As a Taiwanese, I feel they are enthusiastic about bringing authentic and premium quality tea to customers overseas.

It's giving ""The Love Witch"".

I highly recommend trying the Altina Le Blanc organic wine, it‚Äôs so refreshing and pairs beautifully with the high tea meal. For fellow rose lovers like me, the Pink Lady Tea is a must-try, with its delicate floral notes that make the whole experience even more magical.

Whether you're celebrating a wedding, baby shower, small gathering, or just indulging in some leisure time with friends, The Third Tier is the perfect spot. We booked in advance, and I recommend doing the same for horse racing days, they're open from 10 AM to 3 PM. For those who love a relaxing start to the day, breakfast begins at 9 o‚Äôclock, with morning coffee and sandwiches available for a laid-back experience.

The decor is pure elegance, with a blend of French and English styles, making the atmosphere feel luxurious. We indulged in traditional housemade scones with delicious cream and jam, which were truly the highlight of our visit!

For a sophisticated afternoon of leisure, The Third Tier also could offer table painting, paint and sip sessions, or even ladies' games for a bit of fun (for your celebratory needs). Whatever the occasion, whether it‚Äôs a bridal shower or just a classy sandwich with friends, this is the place to be!"

The tea options were all delicious, and I recommend trying the Blue Tango tea, it's delicious. The food was delicious and there was only one item I wasn't a fan of. The atmosphere was quite lovely and the tea sets used, plates, etc., were all beautifully matched. Don't be fooled by the fact it's located on the busy Nicholson/Blyth intersection, it's an oasis of calm and elegance inside."

I brought a friend of mine along with me, who didn't find boba tea as appealing when we had it in other places but she loved this one. We went there today and I found that the quality of the drinks have been consistent which I have not found in other places, so I like this place + I can sit and talk with my friend while drinking tea.

Melbourne,tea house,Amazing Graze Tea Rooms,ChIJlVoyxpJd1moR5jWnk8NO-to,"524 Mt Alexander Rd, Ascot Vale",4.2,Justin Hawke,"Possibly the most disappointing high tea I've ever experienced (having had in excess of forty over the past few years). The service was adequate, with food and tea brought promptly (granted, we were the only customers there). The seating and decor are quite lovely, with the scent of flowers wafting from the adjoining flower shop.

However, the main issue - and it's a significant one - is the quality and quantity of the food. For $70 per person, we only received two rather tasteless sandwiches each, a dry bao and a miniscule arancini ball as savouries. Sweets only consisted of four (two each) small macarons. There was also one scone each, which was fine. Needless to say, for the price paid this was an incredibly meagre serving. Would not recommend unless considerable changes were made in this area."

Was told the night before that the address had changed from Essendon to Ascot Vale. Venue isn't finished, half empty, tradies walking in and out as it is still under construction.

We sat on stained chairs, and at plastic trestle tables with a sheet of foam laid on top, covered with a tablecloth. Bathroom was filthy and had to walk through the construction zone to get there.

Arrived at 10, didn't receive our drinks until after 11.15, didn't receive food until close to 12. We let them know in advance one of our party has allergies, they didn't have food prepared separately for him as they said they would. Even though we paid extra money to ensure he had separate food provided.

Minimal food for our party of 9 and not great quality. The platters came out half empty as they didn't have the scones ready yet. When the scones did come out, they were tiny and we only got 1 each. We all left hungry.

Staff were not apologetic at all, quite rude and defensive.  Extremely overpriced and overhyped experience, definitely won't be back."

A banana bread and coffee from McDonald is a five star experience. I had a Mango Mousse slice here, yesterday. It was as if I‚Äôm eating a mud. The cake wasn‚Äôt fresh and looked like it has been stored from days before. I and other customers also saw a fly flying on top of the cakes in the front window, I immediately informed their staff about the matter.
When I provided my feedback about the cake and whatever I heard the day before about their process, today their management called me and in a very rude manner told otherwise - puzzled me who‚Äôs right/who‚Äôs wrong?

Overall, this tea room is totally fake and lacks everything to deserve a good name. High-end name needs advanced effort and professionalism!"

Stepping into The Tea Room in the Block Arcade is like stepping back in time into an era of elegance and charm. This extraordinary shop, dating back to 1892, is a true Melbourne gem that captures the essence of the city‚Äôs rich history.

We recently had the pleasure of sharing coffee in this remarkable setting, and it was an experience to remember. The ambience is nothing short of magical, with its ornate d√©cor, high ceilings, and a timeless atmosphere that transports you to another world. It‚Äôs clear that The Tea Room has preserved its historical roots while offering a warm and welcoming space for visitors.

The coffee itself was exquisite, perfectly brewed, and served with a touch of class that matches the grandeur of the surroundings. Every sip was a reminder of why this place has stood the test of time‚Äîit's not just a caf√©; it's a destination that offers a unique blend of history, elegance, and culinary delight

Whether you're a local or a visitor, The Tea Room in the Block Arcade is a must-visit. It‚Äôs more than just a place to enjoy a coffee; it‚Äôs an experience steeped in history and tradition, offering a taste of Melbourne‚Äôs past in the most extraordinary way."

Traditional high tea ($75pp)
This set features various savoury sandwiches, fresh scones and sweet cakes, with a choice of coffee or a pot of tea. I liked the sweet peach and strawberry guava tea.

The scone were freshly baked and fluffy, paired well with the raspberry jam and cream.

Savoury menu includes tarts with caramelized onion and feta, pumpkin and sage. I loved their refreshing classic cucumber and cream cheese sandwich!

The sweet menu was right out of a fairytale! With adorable plating and amazing flavours! My favourite was the lemon tea cake! The white chocolate matcha cake had a mild matcha taste, and well balanced sweetness.

I've actually been there a few times before just for takeaway coffee and have been meaning to try their afternoon tea!

It was a nice experience and I would be back soon! This set is more expensive, but it's perfect for a special occasion, or a nice day out with just because flowers ü©∑"

I don't mind paying top dollar for food but when it says lemongrass chicken and its just a ball of chicken mince with no flavouring thats really dissappinting.

I wish I'd done so earlier, because it was soooo incredibly good and delicious.  Honestly, the food is great.  The food takes a little bit of time to come out (even during non peak times), but the actual service is very good and they're attentive and the meals all came out at the same time, which is almost unheard of in many Chinese restaurants (that I've been to).   They even give you delicious sugar cookies at the end of the meal.
They could definitely stand to freshen up and modernise the decor and repaint the dirty and old shabby looking walls, but overall that's really about the only complaint.  Everything we ate, we loved and I'll definitely be coming back again."

The service was excellent, and the environment is perfect for a relaxing tea time. They offer a wide variety of teas, which I absolutely loved, even though they are quite expensive. I purchased some tea leaves before leaving, but was surprised to see that they weighed and sealed them in plastic, costing me $15-$17 for 15gram.It would be nice if they provided a proper can or more decent packaging. That said, I can‚Äôt deny how good the tea tastes, and I‚Äôll definitely be back. Just a friendly reminder: there's a 10% surcharge on weekends, even when buying loose tea, and they also charge a 10% service fee. Sounds a bit crazy, right? Haha."

I even added extra vanilla cream on top. With just one sip, the layers of flavor are so rich.

- Beautiful rooms, lovely table setup including stunning pink roses
- Food was presented well
- Finger sandwiches were nice enough
- Gluten free option was good (I didn‚Äôt get gluten poisoning so that‚Äôs always a bonus for us coeliacs!)

Cons
- Service was extremely slow
Our sandwiches and hot food trays were delivered within 15 minutes of arrival BUT
We were not asked for tea (or coffee) orders, as we assumed at least a pot of each would be brought to us...but no. Eventually after 45 minutes we asked for some! Only a pot of tea was brought to our table, no coffee. We were then told that had to be ordered by the cup.
- Staff and owner not that friendly
Perhaps they were all having a bad day, but there definitely wasn‚Äôt service with a smile the day we went!
- Hot food was not hot, more like lukewarm on delivery to the table
- Had to ask for tomato sauce (who serves pies without that?)

They would be more efficient if they planned and prepared better, rather than constantly running backwards and forwards, especially when there are so many little separate rooms.

Final verdict
Unfortunately I have to say I wouldn‚Äôt return here or recommend it to others."

Jack, Henry and the team create their own ingredients that go into each and every cocktail to perfection. Cannot find another bar like this in Melbourne. The food is also on another level with Hong Kong influence especially, the Duck, the Chicken and the Signature Pineapple Bread. Crispy skin and juicy texture blows my mind with every bite. The ambience lends to a romantic mood, though can also be enjoyed with intimate friends. The best combination of food and cocktail will satisfy the uninitiated and once experienced, will claim The Mongkok Tea House to be a Melbourne iconic institution. 5 Stars!"

The appetizers are no jokes!
Got to try their oysters, truffle arancini (the best i've ever tasted), drunken kingfish crudo, crispy pork mantou, and pineapple bun.
Amazingly, none of them dissapoint!!

Not only the appetizers, the main dish are also really good, especially the corn-fed duck! I can confidently say this is the star of the dish!

Also tried the Jasmine soy Barramundi, it has a unique taste, but I enjoyed it!

Definitely don't forget the cocktail, guys!
You'll missing out a lot if you forget to try it, as their baristas are all participated in the barista championship and some even made it to the top 10!!

How great is that?

Make your move up here and try it yourself!"
Melbourne,tea house,Mongkok Tea House,ChIJLaQl2SxB1moR9iq_Ta6yYQA,"734 Burke Rd, Camberwell",4.6,Justin Tan,"A group of us came here for the banquet meal at $89/person. Each item in the menu comes mostly on a shared plate, even the dessert, which is odd. I would suggest that the dessert be served individually because you are using the same spoon each time you dig into the dessert. It's not unhygienic.  The outstanding items are the oyster (1 per person), barramundi, and poached chicken. The cocktails are very nice. I have the Yolada and the orange blossom.  I highly recommend the latter. The place is dimly lit, making it difficult to take good photos."

Not worth $125 adult per head. No organised activities for the kids although advertised. The food was good quality. But the event was messy and the staff were totally untrained and confused. Everything was dumped on the table and we didn‚Äôt know what was what - kids vs ours vs vegetarian. The kids food was placed in front of one child and none for the other. And vegetarian food was placed next to the other child. Just confusing. Staff were polite but our waitress looked at me blankly when I explained that we had not requested vegetarian food. Later I gained another waiters attention and he called their manager who rectified the problem and explained what food was for adults vs kids. Tablecloth too long - metres of cloth was tucked under the table to stand on. Coffee was cold. They only half filled the champagne glass. Poorly organised service. To top it off, they asked our guests to pay for the additional person rather than ask us. Having said all that, the staff were polite and readily attended to our beverage needs. And the food was plentiful and tasty."

I've booked it last minute for mother's day for my wife. We had a few dietaries too, and they took down our booking without a deposit, no fuss, no issues.
The venue is on the 4th floor of the Pan Pacific Hotel in Southbank, Melbourne. It has premium views of the Yarra, up and downstream.

The ambiance exceeds what you'd expect from a world class hotel in a busy district of any metropolitan city.

When it comes to food.... Oh the food...
It was so delicious that I almost convinced my wife to stay for the second sitting as well.

Melbourne,tea house,Afternoon Tea at The Hotel Windsor,ChIJHVs9FllD1moRM0817WiLGzo,"111 Spring St, Melbourne",4.5,Elissa Hunter,"Oh dear, how disappointing. My husband and I had Afternoon Tea at The Hotel Windsor today and it was quite underwhelming. I've had high tea here in the past and it was everything you would expect from a paragon of elegance and style. Unfortunately, today's experience was not up to the standard one expects at The Windsor. Our greeting was warm and friendly, and the service staff were all very attentive. Sadly, the details did not deliver. No white linen table cloths, bare faux marble tables. China was a bit daggy, our milk jug had a chip in the spout. The sparkling wine, teas and hot chocolate were great, however the food offered was below the standard expected for the price and reputation of the hotel. The savoury stand was just ok,  nothing special, scones were passable but the sweet patisserie was very poor. One espresso small cake between the two of us (which was a shame because it was the best thing on the plate, aren't we worth one each?) and 4 rather non descript, vaguely fruity/spiced cakes. No variety of flavours between them and none especially delicious. No chocolate? No little raspberry macaroon? Lemon tart? Cheesecake?
By comparison with the previous high tea at the Windsor, and other (less expensive) high teas I've had around Melbourne, this was definitely the poorest.
Such a shame that the great institution that is high tea at The Windsor is no longer 'the best'. Go elsewhere, you'll be happier."

The decoration of this place is just gorgeous and it is probably one of the most instagramable bubble tea places I have been. Super soft tones of salmon and white, with some gold touches and the vibe is just so enjoyable that you will want to sit here for hours!

I actually have visited this place 5 times (in 2 months!) and have to say that I will keep coming back. Their acai bowls are AMAZING in terms of size, taste, consistency and toppings! Price is also very reasonable and fair - it comes in a small or regular size.
They now have another option of pistachio soft serve and although I haven't tried it yet, I have to make sure I do next time.

The bubble tea menu they have is also incredible in terms of options as expected and they also have soy milk available as a diary-free option.

There are also other items on the menu such as mochi waffle that looks like a normal waffle but actually has a mochi consistency! How cool. There's 3 different flavours and they are quite popular.

The staff was lovely and the place/atmosphere is just bliss.
Would 100% come back!

I did not ask the staff about this because i thought pecans would be underneath the flakey powdery skins, but no.
Also ur staff attitude is the worst comparing to all the milktea stores ive been to in Melbourne, the staff who took my order could not hide abit of her impatience, as if she‚Äôs superior üòÖbro i just wanted to order a milktea, the one and only role that u had was take my order, and just go on, if u cant even put up with a normal customer for 1 sec when u take their order, then get out of hospitality and do something else, its not my fault u hate ur jobüòÖüòÖüòÖ

Also tried the frozen watermelon but did not taste any natural watermelon, it was like all powder only and flavoring so it wasnt worth the price. With normal sugar it was very very sweet.

The variety of pearls offered is great but they only add a very small portion.

Service was quick and since this is located in the foodcourt , there is a good seating area."

I have never seen such ATTITUDE in my years of reviewing establishments. I paid over $30 worth of Bubble Tea and was treated this way? This is not the SHARETEA I know.

I also had a passionfruit galaxy tea but found it not as full bodied although I adored its galactic multicoloured appearance. My third drink was the black sugar fresh milk tea and I absolutely loved the pearls in this. Probably a tad too sweet but I really enjoyed the flavours and I believe you can ask for half sugar if you like. There‚Äôs a crazy number of options to choose from so I was glad these three were dictated to me as the popular choice"

Yesterday, I bought a bubble tea, but when I tried to open the seal with the straw, the cup broke. I asked the staff member for a replacement, but she laughed and told me I had to pay for a new one. I explained that the breakage wasn‚Äôt my fault, but she was dismissive and moved on to the next customer.

As a regular customer, I found this response very frustrating. Sometimes, packaging can be faulty, whether it‚Äôs a weak cup or a loose seal, and it wouldn‚Äôt have cost much to replace my drink. I hope you can understand how disappointing this experience was and consider improvements to both packaging and customer service!"

‚òÜ Loved the 'a la carte' vibe of this salon. Most high teas in Melbourne require advanced bookings and payments. Instead here, we were able to turn up, choose what we wanted to eat, and pay afterwards.

‚òÜ We weren't hungry enough for the 'High Tea' experience, so we chose the 'Scones for Two' (which came with two beverages) and 'Sandwich Platter'. Scones were phenomenal ‚Äì light, warm and fluffy. Sandwiches were fresh and came in assorted flavours.

‚òÜ Salon indoors is a little tight for space. It was a struggle balancing all our plates and tableware on our tiny table. Next time, we might try to sit at a table outside the salon (in the middle of the shopping complex).

‚òÜ Returned for the High Tea ($45 per person). Certainly a bit pricier than your average high tea in Melbourne for what we got. However, still enjoyed the experience. The sweets and savouries were scrumptious."

I brought a friend of mine along with me, who didn't find boba tea as appealing when we had it in other places but she loved this one.

I'm especially in love with their ""Spring on Peach Mountain."" What kind of divine milk tea is this? Its soft pink color feels like holding a cup that could summon peach blossoms. I even added extra vanilla cream on top. With just one sip, the layers of flavor are so rich. The sweet cream blends perfectly with the smooth milk tea, and the strong tea aroma, with a slight bitterness, balances the taste beautifully‚Äînot too sweet or overwhelming. If you choose a hot drink, make sure to go for full sugar, or the flavor might be a bit bland."

So today‚Äôs choice of vendor was the M store (undisclosed name for legal purposes). The milk tea was horrendous. It was so bad that we couldn‚Äôt finish our milk teas and we had to throw them away, then we decided to drive to T Theory because it‚Äôs right around the corner to dispose the two untouched M milk teas and to get new ones. When we got to the godly T Theory store, the employee initially told me that the store was closed. Feeling defeated I ranted about how terrible my day was and the one thing that was going to save it was even worse. Hearing that, that angel of a staff member offered to make me the most heavenly and beautifully constructed cups of milk tea ever grazed the surface of our Earth. It is so refreshing and so soul touching that my boyfriend shed a single tear. So thank you, for that kind stranger that I did not have the courtesy to ask for her name, for saving my day, and making my whole week. To T-Theory, from your new biggest fan/customer, if that lady (working at 10.30pm on 31st July 2024) wasn‚Äôt an owner, you MUST raise her salary by at least 25%. I thank you, T-Theory for introducing the world to her. We will continue taking out business back here REPEATEDLY and we urge who ever reads this to do the same.

Not only that, she was also extremely rude to the other wait staff. Definitely not a good look and a very disappointing experience."

The decoration of this place is just gorgeous and it is probably one of the most instagramable bubble tea places I have been. Super soft tones of salmon and white, with some gold touches and the vibe is just so enjoyable that you will want to sit here for hours!

I actually have visited this place 5 times (in 2 months!) and have to say that I will keep coming back. Their acai bowls are AMAZING in terms of size, taste, consistency and toppings! Price is also very reasonable and fair - it comes in a small or regular size.
They now have another option of pistachio soft serve and although I haven't tried it yet, I have to make sure I do next time.

The bubble tea menu they have is also incredible in terms of options as expected and they also have soy milk available as a diary-free option.

There are also other items on the menu such as mochi waffle that looks like a normal waffle but actually has a mochi consistency! How cool. There's 3 different flavours and they are quite popular.

The staff was lovely and the place/atmosphere is just bliss.

Berry sparkling drink, this will remind you of all things summer, so relaxing to sip on this even on a cold winter afternoon. The fresh minty taste will really make you feel refreshed. Must try
Aloe Vera honey and lemon drink, the sweet and sourness are so perfectly balanced in this drink. Strongly recommended and it‚Äôs very delicious
Brown sugar boba milk, oh my this is by far the best brown sugar boba drink I had in the city, the boba is so soft and melts in my mouth, the warmth of this drink is perfect to make you feel good in this weather. Very yummy and addictive, also it‚Äôs not very sweet enough to make you enjoy the flavours.

Also the vibe here is so cool and relaxing, just walk in to their store on Elizabeth street, order your favourite drink or two and enjoy it.

Going into the store is a great experience - the owner is friendly, knowledgable and generous with his time, allowing you to smell each tea while you make your selections. He will also take the time to explain things to you and recommend teas according to your preferences.

He taught me an extremely important lesson about maximising flavour extraction from tea leaves by brewing first in a jug/mug, then pouring it into your drinking cup through a fine double mesh sieve (which they also sell here). My tea has never tasted better.

Online deliveries are super reliable as well and always arrive within a couple of days.

I cannot recommend this place enough. Just the best tea shop I‚Äôve ever been to, hands down."

A good pro was the fact they provide a mini plastic knife to open the seal in order to drink the cheese foam. Overall a good experience with nothing special."

I ordered a large milk tea yet the cup wasn't filled to the top, which is unusual as other tea shops usually provide a full cup even when no ice is requested.

Additionally, the slice cake I've ordered here before was so generous it required a larger container. However, this time, the portion was reduced significantly. It seems like the servings vary significantly, Is there a standard size for portions, or are they given randomly?"

The packaging is impressively well-crafted, giving off a premium vibe that comes with a higher price tag for both the cakes and drinks.

They have a huge selection of flavours and toppings, which is definitely a plus. I went for a classic brown sugar milk tea with tapioca pearls, and the tea itself was good - strong and flavourful. The pearls were a bit on the chewier side than I like, but that's a personal preference.

One thing that surprised me was the atmosphere. The place was clean and bright, but it felt more like a grab-and-go coffee shop than a place to relax and enjoy a drink. The music was loud, and the seating was a bit cramped.

Overall, Top Tea is a decent option for a quick bubble tea fix. If you're looking for a place to catch up with friends and chat, there might be better options out there."

I have never had a problem with their service, usually quick to take my order.

The milk tea was rich and deep without being overpowering. The plain bubble waffle was hot, fluffy and crisp - if you have a nut allergy, specify that you don't want Nutella. Prices were very reasonable.

I asked for a sample which they normally give it to you, to making sure was going to be the exact tea for me to purchase and they said "" no we don't give sample anymore"" which is a lie because  at ringwood shopping center everytime I would like to try a new tea, I ask for a sample and than following the purchase.  It's $20 I want to make sure I like that tea. And she was not even trying to help me with my issue. Not happy at all."

I was greeted with the most welcoming service I've encountered. The workers were so kind and funny, and at the time I was carrying a heap of heavy books in a paper bag, which embarrassingly ripped open when I was at the counter upon leaving. The woman at the front counter went out of her way to retrieve a new bag for me. I felt so bad that I offered to pay for it, and she insisted I didn't, and then proceeded to double bag it for added security for the trip home on the train. I never write reviews but 100% wanted to show gratitude for that act of kindness. I wish I had gotten a name, but she was this gorgeous woman with bangs. I purchased the mangoes and cream tea - absolutely delicious! I even tried it with that same lady's suggestion; iced and with fresh fruit - will definitely be my favourite for some time, and will definitely be back for these amazing products and exceptional service. Thanks so much! Your act of kindness will not go unnoticed."

My partner and I saw the promotion poster and we arrived at 5.15pm on 10th October. We spent few minutes time to look on the menu, after we decided the drinks and we walked to the order counter, we wait there for a while, there is a lady staff eventually saw us and just said "" we are closed"", her other colleague said to her ""aren't we finished at 6?"" The lady said to us ""we have too many orders""

My partner and  I were so disappointed üò¢ You have a promotion showing the time is between 11am to 6pm. And the reason you are not accepting orders is because there are too many orders, we don't understand why you do this promotion. Moreover, we didn't see any 'Closed' or 'Sold out' signage. If so, we won't waste our time looking at the menu. They didn't even say any apologies, even they could say ""oh, sorry we are sold out"", this will make a bit of sense.

We will never go back again!"

The amount of toppings served is the winner! Large milk tea with all the beautiful toppings for $5 only, so cheap! This is the best tasting, best value milk tea in St Albans. Not getting $7-8 milk tea from Gong-cha anymore.
The original milk tea is a must try - it's like the Filipino version of halo-halo but in the form of a milk tea.
Huge plus is that the store is environmentally conscious with their packaging.

It is a very small store with no seating space at all, but the pick up table area has not been cleaned properly, always got trash and spots of cream on it.

Customer service: there is a specific staff that has been quite rude when taking orders. It‚Äôs the one that the other comments have been mentioning. Please train the staff properly. There‚Äôs no greetings and they just assumed that I speak Chinese so they just started talking to me in Chinese without me saying anything. This happened multiple times with multiple staffs.

Quick and efficient service. Milk tea for $9 is outrageous but can be reasoned by their crazy and innovative concoctions - from milk tea, fruit teas with cheese foams, to yoghurts and very odd yet yummy drinks, your options are endless!

We each loved our drink:
Black sugar milk tea (3.5/5): classic milk tea. Not the best tasting, but the pearls were super soft and bouncy.

Chrysanthemum milk tea with lychee jelly (4/5): not too sweet since we asked for less sugar, and very refreshing!

Mango yoghurt popping pearls (4/5): breakfast but in a better form. Popping pearl gave it that fun element and a pop of sour and sweet, and yoghurt balanced that sour kick to it, whilst still tasting the mango. However, wish the authentic mango flavour was more pronounced.

Strawberry macchiato (4.5/5): refreshing and creamy! Tastes like strawberries and cream.

Proper thin foam layer on the flat white and super tasty beans from Seven Seeds.

I ordered the Cloud Float, priced at $10, which was supposed to feature coconut water and coconut foam. However, I couldn't detect any coconut flavor, and instead of sage, it had rosemary on top. The coffee itself was decent, but the overall drink was disappointing.

The location and ambiance of the cafe are excellent, but the quality of the drink did not justify the price. Overall, I did not enjoy my experience as much as I had hoped."

The last time I dined here was 7 years ago. The chorizo bagel I had back then was well put together and very tasty. The lack of customer service was, however, quite off-putting.

We recently tried Manchester Press again, and we can't fault the warm staff at all. Unfortunately, it was the food that didn't quite hit the mark this time.

We ordered the Bacon and Maple Bagel ($24.50), which on paper sounds like the perfect combination of sweet and savoury. However, it was actually quite difficult to get all the flavours together as it was quite textural. We also weren't sure whether the blueberry bagel was the best flavour to compliment this creation.

We fared a bit better with the Philly Steak Bagel ($23.80), although the chef may have gone a bit overboard with the chipotle mayo and the overall result was not that aesthetically pleasing.

Hojicha Latte ($6.50) is on its current special menu for those wanting to try something different.

It was overall a slightly underwhelming experience, but I am hoping it was only because we went on a bad day..."

ü•Øü´ê I‚Äôve had very fond memories of their blueberry bagel served with the best mascarpone cream mixed with berries and pistachio, so I decided to visit them again after at least 5 years. It most definitely did not disappoint even though the way they whip the cream is now a little different.

I highly recommend the mixed berry bagel if you want a sweet brunch.

üç≥ We also had their Egg Benedict and it was superb with a generous serving of bacon.

üçØ Another bagel we tried was their honey ricotta toast, I would have preferred they served a bigger portion of ricotta rather than thinly spread it on the bagel. I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying more for it too. I suppose this highlights the bagel rather than the topping."

Our coffee was still pretty good actually. But our bagels didn‚Äôt look or taste nearly as exciting and they used to.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶ they were absolutely fine. Just nothing special. The smoked salmon looks unhappy and tasted like supermarket salmon, and the blueberries were sparing.

I ordered a small latte and a hashbrown wrap, and they both came pretty quickly. Admittedly, the latte tasted pretty weak, then again, I am used to stronger coffees. The hashbrown wrap, however, has the very right balance of flavours, the thick slice of eggs, the hash potatoes, the bacon, and the thin layer of barbecue sauce woke my stomach up very well.

Both items came together around AUD12, it was a nice start of the morning"

Having previously tried their strawberry matcha, I was eager to order it again. However, this time, there seemed to be a shortage of strawberries, throwing off the overall balance a bit.

On the other hand, hojicha, a personal favourite of mine, had a nice roasted flavour throughout. The yakult sparkling drink proved to be incredibly refreshing, hitting all the right spots, especially on the day we visited when the temperature soared to 35 degrees. To round off the experience, the croissant was light and crispy but fell into the category of being quite average, lacking any standout qualities.

I'd suggest giving their drinks a try since that's their specialty, despite some occasional inconsistency, they are still quite good! With multiple locations around Melbourne too.

I was really let down by the drinks though, the chai didn't have much flavour to it, I wouldn't come back. my dad loves his coffees but also didn't really enjoy it from here

seems like a lovely store, if you're not too picky with your drinks it's nice to visit, but otherwise I'd recommend going elsewhere"

I started off with an espresso made with their Yunnan beans. It was refreshing, light, and floral with good acidity. I finished off with a pour over from their heavier Brazilian beans.

2nd visit (Aug 2024): got an iced latte and a iced black, dined in. service was cold, coffee was diluted and overall underwhelming. Melbourne has a really competitive coffee scene and this place is a skip. For better coffee, much friendlier service and less pretentious vibe, try Rosso instead‚Ä¶ or maybe of the other places Melbourne has to offer"
Melbourne,coffee,Brother Baba Budan,ChIJ6VLiOLVC1moRUX_Qgb0CEyU,"359 Little Bourke St, Melbourne",4.6,Alice,"The decor is awesome. Only one large square table inside and some outdoor seating space available.
They have single origin beans (extra $1) available, remember to ask for it when you order your coffee.
The latte was surprisingly on the more milky side.
I guess because the cafe is always busy, the staff was as friendly as other cafes around the CBD."

The cafe offers a wide range of coffee options, albeit at a high price point. I decided to try the coffee based on the positive reviews I'd heard. I ordered an almond cappuccino, and my friend had a batch brew. Although the prices were steep, the quality of the coffee was exceptional. The flavor profiles were spot-on, and we thoroughly enjoyed our drinks.

Overall, despite the higher cost, the quality of the coffee made it worth the visit."

The coffee machine is manned by a very friendly and vocal gentleman churning out coffees to his regulars. I opted for a bircher muesli with cinnamon and honey and a cafe latte. The muesli had fresh berries and tasted good with the drizzle of honey. The coffee was also good and strong flavoured and a welcome relief after the stuff I had tried at other places. For around 14 AUD for both, definitely competent pricing for the location. Highly recommended."
Melbourne,coffee,Coffee Rush,ChIJgcnDD09d1moRm0MYYpUgC2c,"Street Level, 201 Spencer St, Docklands",4.4,Pelican,"Absolutely recommend to come here, but perhaps stick to takeaway.

I have been here a number of times for their excellent coffee when I have been travelling through Melbourne, but in my most recent trip I decided to eat in. To cut a long story short, when I received my order (toasted banana bread, which was lovely), it was in a takeaway bag. I asked for some cutlery to eat it, to which I was told ""we don't do that here"". Inside, an employee was enjoying some food with his two friends, both with cutlery and a plate.

I'm not sure if was just that that person was having an off-day, but it definitely put me off since to be told that a cafe has no cutlery to dine in is... odd. I'll no doubt come back, but will stick to takeaway."

Ordered a flat white- the milk was not steamed properly, leaving a thinly textured cup with minimal forced latte art. The espresso tasted over extracted (bitter)
Ordered a toasted salmon bagel- again it was just a very dry bagel with salmon stuffed inside. Absolutely not worth the expensive pricing. Avoid."

It was so awful that I had to order it again from another cafe (one that tasted like real cappaccino). Also, one of the staff members who served me wasn't very friendly, and when I asked for sugar, she had a very annoyed look on her face. A bare minimum standard of customer service and coffee quality should at least be met, especially if you're based in Melbourne and honestly I would think the $2 coffee from 7-Eleven would meet that than this one. I'm sure this cafe is loved by locals, which is why I want to put up this review to hopefully enable some improvement in the future for their business."

For the price they‚Äôre charging $9, I expected something exceptional, but it turned out to be just average in both size and taste. The portion wasn‚Äôt anything special, and the flavor was nothing to write home about‚Äîdefinitely not worth the premium price. I‚Äôve had better croissants elsewhere for much less. It feels like they‚Äôre charging more just for the sake of it, without delivering on quality. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre looking for value for money."

Own coffee roasted for shop. Smooth, medium style coffee.
My Latte, 1.5 shot, come in smallish cup, but was well made, and smooth.
Only problem was our coffees were only just warm!
Such a sophisticated coffee shop, was disappointing they could not make the coffee at correct temperature.
If you like your coffee stronger, you would definitely need extra shot.

We got the pork belly and lamb ribs for main and the tiramisu and mudcake for dessert. A thing to note is the dessert portion sizes are massive so you can definitely share one between people. My mum and I got one each and ended up taking half of both home.
Melbourne,coffee,The Quarter,ChIJzRa1FbRC1moR01tSbLByQ8s,"27-31 Degraves St, Melbourne",4.3,Cass C,"With so many options in Degraves, I decided to try The Quarter, but unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations. I ordered the pulled pork eggs Benedict and the New York bagel, but both dishes were missing key elements. The eggs Benedict was supposed to come with crunchy crackling, which was absent, and the New York bagel didn‚Äôt have the mayo as advertised on the menu.

On the bright side, the eggs were cooked well, and the Hollandaise sauce was tasty. However, the service left something to be desired‚Äîalthough our waiter was good the service from the food runners felt a bit abrupt, which added to the overall disappointment.

With so many great spots nearby, I might explore other options next time."

What we ordered:
üçÉ Zucchini Flowers $26
ü§ç Scallops Linguine $34.50
üçÖ Rigatoni all'Amatriciana $27
ü§é Tiramisu $16.50

The food and the ambience here makes for the perfect hang out spot whether you're having a date night or catching up with friends & family. They even had live music on when we visited on a Thursday evening and it was such a vibe!

Onto the food, everything we ate was yum but my favourite dish was definitely the rigatoni. I'm not normally a big fan of tomato / red sauce base pastas but wow this one was sensational. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the bits of pancetta were pan fried to perfection.

Also if you come here make sure to leave some room for their dessert! I was pleasantly surprised at how big the tiramisu serving was and it was soooo delicious. I like that it wasn‚Äôt overly sweet and it was actually the perfect size to share between two.

You can find this charming restaurant on Degraves Street which is just a two minute walk away from Flinders Street Station."

Coffee was great. GF ricotta, banana & chocolate serving was very small. Chocolate was chocolate sprinkles. Would never have asked for that.
My real gripe is that I asked to use a ladies room. They said I‚Äôd have to walk to Collins Place. They also voluntarily advised they had a key to the apartments next door, but only staff could use it. I advised that I had Crohn‚Äôs disease and could present a commonwealth government card explaining that I am entitled to use any toilet available. They declined. I had to leave quickly. They then checked with the manager who also advised I was not able to use the facility. NOT GOOD ENOUGH"

The coffee was way too smooth for my taste not enough depth, but I can see how some people like this style of coffee.

Nice design of the shop but the walls are looking a bit grubby.

Returned after a bit of a break to a disappointing experience. The staff were very friendly, the place looks exactly the same as it was a decade back but the food wasn't particularly nice.

The salmon fritters were incredibly dry and tasted like paper and salmon is definitely not the main ingredient by a long shot. An avalanche of onion at the bottom was weird too. Don't say pomegranate in the menu if you literally are throwing in a couple randomly.  The baked eggs were slightly better if very watery and soupy.

Coffees were very good though.

Not in a hurry to come back."

As a well-known coffee shop in the city, I expected above-average service. When we walked in, the barista, who was also handling the counter, rudely asked us to wait. Although we were not in a rush and waited patiently, she didn't make eye contact or greet us kindly when it was our turn to order. The store wasn‚Äôt busy, and while she seemed friendly with her co-worker, her attitude towards us, as customers, was unacceptable. This negatively impacted my coffee experience and the taste of my latte. Bad service and a bad impression of Industry Beans, which is supposed to be a must-try coffee spot. üò¢"

I prefer more chocolate in my hot chocolate; it was quite a small amount, but I still loved it. The carrot cake had a very nice lemon frosting. As for the toastie, its salad could have used some sort of dressing. Despite these comments, I can definitely say I will go there again. The staff are good, and it's a very nice place for taking photos as well!

The silver lining was that the Credit Card Machine asked for tip so I had the opportunity to input 0 tip.

I won't pretend that we knew where we were going because a beautiful soul realised after I inadvertently invaded her space. (She was sweeping around her things and I apologised profusely.)

She asked if we were lost as I got my phone out and explained rather pathetically why I pulled over and didn't mean to interrupt her day. She knew exactly where the best spot to head to for breakfast. This assertive, independent, full of passionate strength and determination was completely patient when she realised I was hearing impaired and my adult son was with me. She made a stop at one shop, didn't like the behaviour of staff then took us straight to Issus Cafe. She insisted we sit in the back corner, told the staff to look after us and didn't leave until she was confident we were good.

Cafe Issus did not disappoint!! Lovely staff, great atmosphere, and we were very pleased.

So much so, we returned on another day for another ADF appointment.

I asked the lady of the house if she knew who I was talking about and she does. I asked if she could thank her because we weren't able to catch up after breakfast and was told this lovely lady comes by often and she will get our thanks to her when she comes in for soup.

Thankyou so much for the opportunity to send our thanks and our yummy breakfast!"

If your buying for home use, we recommend buying our beans in small quantities (1-2 week supply), so that you experience fresh beans more regularly and enjoy your coffee at its peak of excellent. Our beans are roasted to order which means there is no surplus of coffee sitting around getting old until someone buys it.

We want you to enjoy our coffee when it's at its finest. Just like other fresh produce, coffee begins to deteriorate in quality about 14 days after roasting, even under ideal conditions. To ensure you receive your coffee beans in the best condition, we store and ship our coffee in airtight, recyclable/reusable gas valve bags, which helps the coffee retain its freshness and protects against the effects of temperature, light, and air.

Oat porridge was personally chosen as a winter warmer myself, whilst my friend chose the smashed avocado (the most avocado either of us had seen on such a dish). Beverages tried whilst at the venue included traditional such as almond lattes as well as specials such as the house special ‚ÄòNew Orleans cold brew‚Äô and ‚Äòstrawberry iced chai‚Äô (both highly recommended), as well as the chilli hot chocolate, which was terrific on a cool day.

Atmosphere and ambience was great for a terrific conversation, but left a little to be desired when it came to keeping warm (a lot of glass at the venue makes it difficult to maintain the heat, I suppose). Otherwise, absolutely great - looking forward to return and try out other items on the menu!"

I tried the signature fruit tea which was as the name suggests super fruity and you can see the fresh pieces floating through the vibrantly coloured cup.

I also had a passionfruit galaxy tea but found it not as full bodied although I adored its galactic multicoloured appearance. My third drink was the black sugar fresh milk tea and I absolutely loved the pearls in this. Probably a tad too sweet but I really enjoyed the flavours and I believe you can ask for half sugar if you like. There‚Äôs a crazy number of options to choose from so I was glad these three were dictated to me as the popular choice"

They have a huge selection of flavours and toppings, which is definitely a plus. I went for a classic brown sugar milk tea with tapioca pearls, and the tea itself was good - strong and flavourful. The pearls were a bit on the chewier side than I like, but that's a personal preference.

One thing that surprised me was the atmosphere. The place was clean and bright, but it felt more like a grab-and-go coffee shop than a place to relax and enjoy a drink. The music was loud, and the seating was a bit cramped.

Overall, Top Tea is a decent option for a quick bubble tea fix. If you're looking for a place to catch up with friends and chat, there might be better options out there."

The only other thing I had eaten that day was brunch at a fine dining restaurant, several hours earlier, so I‚Äôm pretty sure the bubble tea may have been the cause. The tapioca pearls were a bit firm, but at the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it.

Additionally, the service could have been better.

The packaging is impressively well-crafted, giving off a premium vibe that comes with a higher price tag for both the cakes and drinks. While the cakes may appear visually appealing, their taste doesn't quite match my expectation. However, if you have a sweet tooth and enjoy sugary treats, this is a place worth exploring."

The pearls were very clearly not made fresh and tasted like they were old. The quality of the pearls was also very bad unfortunately. Almost all the boba pearls stuck together in 2 big clumps that sat at the bottom of my drink, I had to throw my drink away because the pearls were clogging up my straw and weren't able to even be removed from it, making it quiet literally undrinkable. The popping pearls also had an oddly plastic/firm casing and were noticeably sagged instead of plumpy and circular like a fresh one would be, leading me to believe they were definitely old ingredients. Ive been to multiple chai times, and the one at unihill is genuinely the only one I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It was an unfortunate experience."

A few days later I realised the transaction went through twice.

07/05/2024 - I had time to go back and talk to staff about it. I spoke to someone who I think has authority, a male of Korean background. He said he wouldn't be able to look up the transaction (fair enough) and suggested I contact head office. I thought options to resolve it were to process a refund or give me one or two drinks. I asked if he wanted to resolve it now and he declined, repeating that I should contact head office.

Nothing wrong with the beverages served, but I do think a part of business, and ratings is how you deal with disputes, and in this case, it's a 1 star."

Strawberry latte had strawberry chunks in it and the flavor came through nicely, panna cotta was creamy and not too sweet. Couldn‚Äôt adjust sugar levels, but could be less sweet IMO.

Black milk tea one was very nice too, after mixing the drink the cr√®me br√ªl√©e flavor came through very nicely. Though the black tea brew could be stronger for my personal preference.

In terms of service, staff were friendly, but I was a bit disappointed for one thing. I had ordered $26 worth of drinks and realized after i left the shop that I could buy 2 more drinks to get up to $40 total and claim Vic govt 25% rebate. I went back an hour-ish later and asked if they could print me a receipt containing both my previous order and new added orders so I could have a bill with a total over $40, but management refused.

Look at the difference of colour. The watermelon crush tasted and even looks so artificial. I went up to the cashier and asked if there was anything they could do about it. Unfortunately, they responded with that there was nothing they could do (I wish that there is a different implemented policy). I completely understand that this drink is unhealthy and that by drinking this that there is presumably something artificial. But to this extent?? I'm even questioning if this is even is safe to consume. It tasted like straight up artificial watermelon powder. No hint of actual watermelon anywhere. Also, I have not filtered the photo in any sort of way, it just looks like this even in real life. Neon pink. I'm NEVER COMING BACK. Hope this review helps other people."

Vs. Teaser which has more premium feeling nicer cups but gong cha is a surprisingly good option. It all just works. Might be my goto if ican figure out what to pick for $20 all up so deluvery is free.

My issue with gong cha is their liquids seem thin. So ive drunk it all too fast. Mix it up or stop watering everything down?"

Flavours I tried ~
1. Brown sugar coffee latte with honey pearls
2. Genmaicha milk with honey pearls
3. Wintermelon lemon juice with herbal jelly
4. Cloudy cream dirty matcha with green tea jelly

I really like that they have a new coffee range with St Ali coffee. The coffee flavour is delicious and there is the option of dirty matcha. They have lots of matcha variety including genmaicha which is more bitter in taste and is good when you don‚Äôt want a sweet drink. A flavour I tried for the first time is the wintermelon and lemon drink that was both sour and sweet which I really liked and was very refreshing. Their pearls are also very soft and chewy, plus they have great topping choices like green tea and coffee jelly.

Definitely visit Milksha for some delicious drink flavours!"

Additionally, I wish there were at least 2-3 people working there instead of one, otherwise there's not enough people to make at least 5 different drinks for 5 5 different customers, and it's annoying how there isn't one specific person in charge, it's just one staff member working there at a time."

I actually have visited this place 5 times (in 2 months!) and have to say that I will keep coming back. Their acai bowls are AMAZING in terms of size, taste, consistency and toppings! Price is also very reasonable and fair - it comes in a small or regular size.
They now have another option of pistachio soft serve and although I haven't tried it yet, I have to make sure I do next time.

The bubble tea menu they have is also incredible in terms of options as expected and they also have soy milk available as a diary-free option.

There are also other items on the menu such as mochi waffle that looks like a normal waffle but actually has a mochi consistency! How cool. There's 3 different flavours and they are quite popular.

The staff was lovely and the place/atmosphere is just bliss.
Would 100% come back!

The staff made a mistake by putting the wrong Topping on my order. When I kindly requested the correct Topping, the staff's response was both impatient and unwilling. Instead of an apology, she somehow 'blamed' me by saying 'most people order this topping.' (?????)

Finally, I was served a drink overflowing with ice. She explained that it was made based on formula.

The service was the worst and most disappointing I've encountered."

Yesterday, I bought a bubble tea, but when I tried to open the seal with the straw, the cup broke. I asked the staff member for a replacement, but she laughed and told me I had to pay for a new one. I explained that the breakage wasn‚Äôt my fault, but she was dismissive and moved on to the next customer.

As a regular customer, I found this response very frustrating. Sometimes, packaging can be faulty, whether it‚Äôs a weak cup or a loose seal, and it wouldn‚Äôt have cost much to replace my drink. I hope you can understand how disappointing this experience was and consider improvements to both packaging and customer service!"

I brought a friend of mine along with me, who didn't find boba tea as appealing when we had it in other places but she loved this one. We went there today and I found that the quality of the drinks have been consistent which I have not found in other places, so I like this place + I can sit and talk with my friend while drinking tea.

The drink I ordered was the ""Rose Green Tea Cherry Blossom"". It had a great balance of sweetness with the tea. The tea is not bitter. The flavour of Cherry Blossom does not overpower the Green Tea. Presentation wise, it's pretty definitely like a rose. And the white pearls inside definitely don't catch your throat, so it's easier to drink. And blends well with the flavour and balance of the Green Tea. Service was on point. Servers knew how to order our drinks and give the drinks to us when they were ready. Even asked us if we wanted a bag. But we didn't need one, so we politely declined. Overall it's a great place to start if you want to get into Bubble Tea, because I had no idea what to drink, let alone which drink would be the right one. So I just picked the prettiest and easiest one to drink. üëçüëç"

Unfortunately, my order was mistakenly prepared as a cold drink. When I brought this mistake to the attention of the staff, they were dismissive and rude, insisting that my request for ice meant the drink should be cold.

The situation escalated when the staff, displaying unprofessional behavior, threw our items on the table and forced us to pick them up. To my dismay, they also told us not to return to the store and to complaint how ever I want, yet they refused to provide their names or wear name tags, which is a basic expectation in customer service.

This level of service is unacceptable and does not reflect the standards one would expect from a reputable establishment. I am requesting that you address this issue and ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future. Additionally, I would appreciate a formal apology for the treatment I received and for the inconvenience caused."

Melbourne,bubble tea,T-Theory,ChIJG_TbHrxD1moRoX5CP2-MgoI,"188 Queensberry St, Carlton",4,Yosh Ha,"I was having a bad day, and the only thing that‚Äôs going to cheer me up is a large, fresh and tasty jasmine green milk tea with less ice, standard sugar (and black pearls yea). So today‚Äôs choice of vendor was the M store (undisclosed name for legal purposes). The milk tea was horrendous. It was so bad that we couldn‚Äôt finish our milk teas and we had to throw them away, then we decided to drive to T Theory because it‚Äôs right around the corner to dispose the two untouched M milk teas and to get new ones. When we got to the godly T Theory store, the employee initially told me that the store was closed. Feeling defeated I ranted about how terrible my day was and the one thing that was going to save it was even worse. Hearing that, that angel of a staff member offered to make me the most heavenly and beautifully constructed cups of milk tea ever grazed the surface of our Earth. It is so refreshing and so soul touching that my boyfriend shed a single tear. So thank you, for that kind stranger that I did not have the courtesy to ask for her name, for saving my day, and making my whole week. To T-Theory, from your new biggest fan/customer, if that lady (working at 10.30pm on 31st July 2024) wasn‚Äôt an owner, you MUST raise her salary by at least 25%. I thank you, T-Theory for introducing the world to her. We will continue taking out business back here REPEATEDLY and we urge who ever reads this to do the same. Thank you for your reading, evidently, I poured my heart and soul into this review, as did that staff member with our milk teas."

The food made in house is absolutely delicious, simple fare perfect for a light breakfast or lunch. Pictured is the house granola with apple and honey and it is a phenomenal way to start your morning.

The reviews must be for the food as the coffee was really mediocre. More importantly, this business also charges customers (rather sneakily) a surcharge for eftpos transactions - which are free Australia wide and banks to not charge vendors. Where a card surcharge is typically 1.5%, I was charged 3% for selecting savings on payment. Too many great coffee places in Melbourne, try somewhere else."

If your buying for home use, we recommend buying our beans in small quantities (1-2 week supply), so that you experience fresh beans more regularly and enjoy your coffee at its peak of excellent. Our beans are roasted to order which means there is no surplus of coffee sitting around getting old until someone buys it.

We want you to enjoy our coffee when it's at its finest. Just like other fresh produce, coffee begins to deteriorate in quality about 14 days after roasting, even under ideal conditions. To ensure you receive your coffee beans in the best condition, we store and ship our coffee in airtight, recyclable/reusable gas valve bags, which helps the coffee retain its freshness and protects against the effects of temperature, light, and air.

Having previously tried their strawberry matcha, I was eager to order it again. However, this time, there seemed to be a shortage of strawberries, throwing off the overall balance a bit.

On the other hand, hojicha, a personal favourite of mine, had a nice roasted flavour throughout. The yakult sparkling drink proved to be incredibly refreshing, hitting all the right spots, especially on the day we visited when the temperature soared to 35 degrees. To round off the experience, the croissant was light and crispy but fell into the category of being quite average, lacking any standout qualities.

I'd suggest giving their drinks a try since that's their specialty, despite some occasional inconsistency, they are still quite good! With multiple locations around Melbourne too.

A great place of coffee for anyone who prefers a laidback simple experience. Lovely photos of owners/family on display. Overall has a very old unchanged homely feeling. Good coffee.

Food came out in under 5 minutes, given a good chunk of bread while you wait. We both scraped our plates clean. Carbonara and their special bolognese gnocchi were out choices for this night. Was very delicious!

So reasonable in price, both meals were $22 each. Will come back to try their lasagne! It looked mouth watering."

Melbourne,coffee shop,The Coffee Company,ChIJR1RkP0Vo1moRUc924x7wfIQ,"260 Carlisle St, Balaclava",4.7,George Slavchev,"I‚Äôm disappointed in my purchase from The Coffee Company.

For a few months now, I‚Äôve been purchasing Hazelnut Coffee from Amazon. These are always imported from the States. I‚Äôve stuck with Dunkin‚Äô Donuts‚Äôs one, which has a rich aroma.

I wanted to see, if I could source something similar in Melbourne and support a local business instead. A quick Google search pointed me towards The Coffee Company.

Upon walking in, I was immediately greeted with a smile and offered assistance.

I got 500g of their Hazelnut Coffee ground for a French press. It was beautifully packaged in their own packaging.

So, service and atmosphere were definitely on point. I was excited!

The moment I got home, the first thing that made me an impression is that there was absolutely no hazelnut aroma coming from the freshly-ground coffee. I brewed a cup, using two heaped spoons. There was absolutely no hazelnut flavour. Not even a hint. It‚Äôs just standard coffee.

Later, I had guests and I made it for them too. They all confirmed that this is definitely not hazelnut-flavoured coffee, but just a standard coffee.

That was hugely disappointing, especially since I purchased half a kilo of it and I didn‚Äôt get what I believed I was paying for.

I won‚Äôt be returning to The Coffee Company."
Melbourne,coffee shop,The Coffee Company,ChIJR1RkP0Vo1moRUc924x7wfIQ,"260 Carlisle St, Balaclava",4.7,Eddie Fares,Reliable and knowledgeable staff. Spend the time and ask about the beans taste profile and make a record of what you bought for future reference. The Coffee company is a micro roaster with many many offers.

Returned after a bit of a break to a disappointing experience. The staff were very friendly, the place looks exactly the same as it was a decade back but the food wasn't particularly nice.

The salmon fritters were incredibly dry and tasted like paper and salmon is definitely not the main ingredient by a long shot. An avalanche of onion at the bottom was weird too. Don't say pomegranate in the menu if you literally are throwing in a couple randomly.  The baked eggs were slightly better if very watery and soupy.

Coffees were very good though.

Not in a hurry to come back."

Onto the food, everything we ate was yum but my favourite dish was definitely the rigatoni. I'm not normally a big fan of tomato / red sauce base pastas but wow this one was sensational. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the bits of pancetta were pan fried to perfection.

Also if you come here make sure to leave some room for their dessert! I was pleasantly surprised at how big the tiramisu serving was and it was soooo delicious. I like that it wasn‚Äôt overly sweet and it was actually the perfect size to share between two.

The shop sign was not very conspicuous, so I walked back and forth twice. A customer nearby hurriedly caught up with me to tell me that the coffee shop was here, but it was already closed. So he persuaded the staff to sell me a cup of coffee. The ownerÔºàor staffÔºâ told me that the coffee machine was already off, but he could give me a cup of cold coffee. When I was ready to pay with my credit card, the owner handed me a cup of coffee and bread and told me there was no need to pay. I was very shocked and also very lucky. It was a really good day for me."

You can also pair your drinks with their savory croissants or bagels.

I ordered the Cloud Float, priced at $10, which was supposed to feature coconut water and coconut foam. However, I couldn't detect any coconut flavor, and instead of sage, it had rosemary on top. The coffee itself was decent, but the overall drink was disappointing.

The location and ambiance of the cafe are excellent, but the quality of the drink did not justify the price. Overall, I did not enjoy my experience as much as I had hoped."

The last time I dined here was 7 years ago. The chorizo bagel I had back then was well put together and very tasty. The lack of customer service was, however, quite off-putting.

We recently tried Manchester Press again, and we can't fault the warm staff at all. Unfortunately, it was the food that didn't quite hit the mark this time.

We ordered the Bacon and Maple Bagel ($24.50), which on paper sounds like the perfect combination of sweet and savoury. However, it was actually quite difficult to get all the flavours together as it was quite textural. We also weren't sure whether the blueberry bagel was the best flavour to compliment this creation.

We fared a bit better with the Philly Steak Bagel ($23.80), although the chef may have gone a bit overboard with the chipotle mayo and the overall result was not that aesthetically pleasing.

Hojicha Latte ($6.50) is on its current special menu for those wanting to try something different.

It was overall a slightly underwhelming experience, but I am hoping it was only because we went on a bad day..."

ü•Øü´ê I‚Äôve had very fond memories of their blueberry bagel served with the best mascarpone cream mixed with berries and pistachio, so I decided to visit them again after at least 5 years. It most definitely did not disappoint even though the way they whip the cream is now a little different.

I highly recommend the mixed berry bagel if you want a sweet brunch.

üç≥ We also had their Egg Benedict and it was superb with a generous serving of bacon.

üçØ Another bagel we tried was their honey ricotta toast, I would have preferred they served a bigger portion of ricotta rather than thinly spread it on the bagel. I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying more for it too. I suppose this highlights the bagel rather than the topping."

There were alot of customers here and it looked like a spot where people would sit down and read books as they sipped away at morning coffee.

The staff were friendly and the service was quick.

Unfortunately our oat flat white had splitting of the oat milk, which made it quite unpleasant to drink. The cows milk flat white was okay but was quick milky.

The service ans the atmosphere was so great that i would be willing to go back and try the coffee again!"

I ordered a small latte and a hashbrown wrap, and they both came pretty quickly. Admittedly, the latte tasted pretty weak, then again, I am used to stronger coffees. The hashbrown wrap, however, has the very right balance of flavours, the thick slice of eggs, the hash potatoes, the bacon, and the thin layer of barbecue sauce woke my stomach up very well.

Both items came together around AUD12, it was a nice start of the morning"

The menu boasts a wide range of beverages, from classic hot drinks to refreshing juices, catering to every preference. On my recent visit, I opted for a chai latte, and I was very impressed. The warmth of the drink made it a comforting choice on a chilly day.

Complementing their drink menu is an impressive selection of pastries. These treats pair wonderfully with any of their drinks and are a great option for a light snack or indulgent treat.

You are paying for the vibe, nothing else. We ordered the paella and the fried chicken. The paella came covered in mayo, fried chicken was probably microwaved. It's not inedible, but bad and covered in sauce. Also it took 30 minutes for us to get the appetizer, the first drinks came 5 minutes later. Server came back another 10 minutes later to ask if we were waiting for anything else (we were waiting for the mains). Pretty disappointed considering the price. The silver lining was that the Credit Card Machine asked for tip so I had the opportunity to input 0 tip.

Edit: In response to the owner, no it was not a busy day. If the paella was indeed ‚Äúa Spanish recipe from the Catalan region‚Äù as opposed to an Americanized version, you have done a disservice to the Spanish people."

I would recommend giving it a try as they offer something slightly different."

So I took the opportunity to enjoy a cup of magic coffee and my favourite Turkey Brie Cranberry toastie inside. The magic coffee was strong, well-balanced flavour profile, just the way I liked it. And their toastie was so delicious, rich in fillings, so yummy, priced at $10, well justified for the quality. They have many selections of toasties and pastries, with gluten-free options. Pocket Espresso Cafe is the best place for good sandwiches and coffee. Great coffee shop at Riverside Quay in Southbank (PwC building). Plus, the staff were super nice!

My real gripe is that I asked to use a ladies room. They said I‚Äôd have to walk to Collins Place. They also voluntarily advised they had a key to the apartments next door, but only staff could use it. I advised that I had Crohn‚Äôs disease and could present a commonwealth government card explaining that I am entitled to use any toilet available. They declined. I had to leave quickly.

The store wasn‚Äôt busy, and while she seemed friendly with her co-worker, her attitude towards us, as customers, was unacceptable.

Always friendly staff and clean premises. The warps are my favourite.giggly toasted to get the cheese melting is perfect for a fulfilling lunch meal.

Paired with a hot beverage and you have the perfect lunch date, when dining alone.

It offers ample seating and there is also the lounge lobby around the side if you need something a little more private or generalist ins seating if you‚Äôre ordering take away.

The packaging has changed on the beans, however, as assured by staff, it has not altered the flavour at all.

Recommend stopping by and taking a seat and enjoying a hot beverage or simple light meal.

Banquette seating and loose furniture. There is also a communal high table. I didn‚Äôt take any photos but will add, there were too many people enjoying themselves and I didn‚Äôt want to be taking too many snaps without their permission.

Everyone a clean, friendly and harmonious environment for breakfast or lunch.

I was told that is my problem because I‚Äôm not liking it.

Both service and food offered were incredible, in which we learned that the menu offered was a fresh menu that had just been released earlier in the week for the winter.

Oat porridge was personally chosen as a winter warmer myself, whilst my friend chose the smashed avocado (the most avocado either of us had seen on such a dish). Beverages tried whilst at the venue included traditional such as almond lattes as well as specials such as the house special ‚ÄòNew Orleans cold brew‚Äô and ‚Äòstrawberry iced chai‚Äô (both highly recommended), as well as the chilli hot chocolate, which was terrific on a cool day.

Atmosphere and ambience was great for a terrific conversation, but left a little to be desired when it came to keeping warm (a lot of glass at the venue makes it difficult to maintain the heat, I suppose). Otherwise, absolutely great - looking forward to return and try out other items on the menu!"

London,cafe,Polo Bar - 24 Hour Great British Cafe,ChIJM2nE97IcdkgRR7nvciwgIWY,"176 Bishopsgate, London",4.3,Thomas Gayler,"Having travelled all the way from Norwich to London for 'brunch', I had booked a table at the Polo Caf√©. The photos of the cafe layout are misleading. Spread over three levels with a ground floor take out, the narrow building layout leaves cramped seating arrangements for customers eating in. There was a warm welcome from staff downstairs, who directed us up stairs and to a specific table. Once upstairs, I was greeted by another member of staff stood behind a kitchen counter, who directed another member of staff to seat us in a different table. Once seated, it is a game of Tetris or snake to get up to use the toilet or get ones food placed on the table. For London prices, I think it was good value, ¬£20 for the mighty breakfast. One member of staff remained behind the counter, while another member of staff seemed to be rushed off their feet attempting to handle all tables. At other restaurants and venues in Norwich, I have had far larger breakfasts living up to the name of 'mighty'. After a 20 minutes wait for food, my food was warm at best, and my friend who ordered eggs Benedict found hair and egg shells in his order. A good venue for someone reaching London Liverpool Street station wanting Breakfast. However, I feel if I did return, it would be for take away, not seating unless it was at a quieter time."

The Village Cafe has a nice family atmosphere where you feel like home and where everyone is trying to make you feel comfortable.

The staff was super friendly and most importantly, the food was tasty, nothing was overcooked or undercooked, it was just on the spot.

There is a very soft playlist of songs in the background so you don't really pay too much attention to it which is great and it allows you to talk with others.

The area around The Village Cafe is quite nice as well and they have outdoor seating if you'd like to sit outside to enjoy the weather.

I had the big breakfast, no bacon, extra sausage, no tomato, no mushroom, extra fried egg. (Pictured)

We were seated straight away, atmosphere is lovely, lots going on!
Staff were friendly, food was hot and prepared quickly.

Cappuccino was gorgeous!
Cooks did a great job!

Will DEFFO come here again!

1 breakfast, 3 coffees and a cake was just under ¬£30!

In Greenwich I view this as great value for such a delicious breakfast!"
London,cafe,The Green Cafe,ChIJq399v4UCdkgR25OBn9PRFuE,"285 Greenwich High Rd, London",4.4,Klara Kim,It can be busy and really loud. I would consider it local place but maybe it‚Äôs just popular for British people in general because of the menu and meals that are served as big portions and for good price.  Sadly the coffee tastes just like in every other franchise cafe shop (meaning it‚Äôs good but if you are coffee lover you will be maybe not amused).

London,cafe,The Green Cafe,ChIJq399v4UCdkgR25OBn9PRFuE,"285 Greenwich High Rd, London",4.4,Tomas,"Sadly I have to leave one star review for this place and for their management's attention. Food: cappuccino was bitter meaning they don't clean filters. By 10:30 am on Saturday they already been out of half sweet menu (they open at 8am, so how they plan food stock no idea, when weekend is usually most busiest for any cafe in town). Service: they brought food quicker than drinks and even then it took forever while place itself still had some seats available at the back. They didn't bring cutlery with food either , we had to ask. Atmosphere: back bar table was sticky so not cleaned properly. And not much space at the back to feel comfortable, meaning they had too many stalls for the space to fit all customers. Also back kitchen had opened doors so you can see everything and it doesn't create nice atmosphere to chill at the cafe. Little things but unfortunately ruins good experience..."

Therefore, i took a picture for you for the real price here. Some are more expensive, and some arent. The second time i ordered the eggs with avocado, and a hazelnut latte coffee."

The taste is just not there. The service could have been more welcoming and useful: this is not customers responsibility to deal with issues of your facilities (especially before using it). Now atmosphere: it felt like the staff doesn‚Äôt care and also like there usually is someone (like an owner or a manager) who interacts with people better and makes this place alive but he/she wasn‚Äôt there when we came maybe, I don‚Äôt know. Something was missing, it was soulless if I may say. That‚Äôs the feeling I had.
Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt come there again BUT I definitely recommend this place for the experience: this place is kind of unique and you cannot argue with that.
Visit the place, feel the presence of Diana if you can, try some food (because it‚Äôs polite to order something if you are visiting and maybe you will like it much more than I did).

Menu spans the globe, but I think the salads look particularly good. If you like a greasy breakfast that‚Äôs on there too, but I thought the chips were a tad underdone and the chicken a tad overdone. That said, the portions were massive and it‚Äôs so reasonably priced you can‚Äôt mind too much.

Lovely staff, did their best to serve us even though we were late and they were closing."

I chose to have the advertised Ethiopian lunch and was delighted by what arrived and the care with which the owner described the dish and how to eat it. Open during the day, but looking to get a licence so that they can serve alcohol in the early evening."
London,cafe,Cafe Florentine.,ChIJ_xDY3JANdkgRUN0zWbkYld8,"Northfield Ave, London",4.6,pp7822,"Attended Cafe Florentine recently to grab some coffee and breakfast. It was an absolute awful experience.

So I came in and the place was quite busy, but seats available. I went to the counter where a staff member was busy moving papers around and did not acknowledge straight away. Fair enough, it looked busy. It took another 30 seconds or so before she did and I asked where the food menu was (as it isn‚Äôt where one would expect - the counter by the till). After I examined the menu and chose what I wanted to order I walked back to the counter where staff again did not acknowledge me and appeared irritated by my presence. One girl walked away.

Now, very frustrated by such poor levels of customer service, a male behind the counter turned around and just stared at me. I pointed out that this is not how you treat perspective customers and I walked out without making any purchase at all. Thankfully there are other fantastic cafes in Northfields where I was made to feel most welcome.

On reflection, they may operate table service only, however, this was neither explained to me nor any signs up to explain this to customers. Very poor. I won‚Äôt be recommending and naturally, I will not be going again. First and last time for me.

Having looked at some of your other reviews, I can see this isn‚Äôt the first time a customer has be made to feel unwelcome. Management really need to address this and fix it quick."

I personally found the staff friendly and  social, and the latter was good. Give it a go, and critical  comments on this place I feel are nit picking, nowhere as bad as they say"

The staff are very good and warm and speedy. The tables are spaced enough apart to have good conversation and good meals.
There is a downstairs which is very good (lacks natural light) but works well.

I like it and will return. It.is not overly expensive in fact fairly reasonable at todays prices.

Definitely should try this as a eat and meet place"
London,cafe,Cafe Zee.,ChIJ95hyMfUNdkgRwjrEUvnwO84,"5 New Broadway, London",3.8,Ginny Fontanilla,"IF YOU‚ÄôRE LOOKING FOR A CAFE WITH  A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT, this place ISN‚ÄôT the one (and I say this with passion - hence the caps lock lol). After having a little look around, seems like a lot of people on here feel the same - especially about the race/ discrimination.

Such a shame, for a cafe with such pleasing interior & nice food only to be let down by its employees doesn‚Äôt the owner/ manager care??

First visit, we got served by a tall blonde lady who at the very start was SO dismissive and for some reason has a phobia of eye contact? Lol looking in a different direction while serving me just overall just had that ‚Äúi dont wanna be here‚Äù attitude. And then later on, I asked the guy barista (short guy, dark hair and wears glasses) for a glass of water and pointed out that it was on the countertop (but somebody clearly forgot to re-fill that section - as it wasn‚Äôt there!) and just basically served me with some attitude like I asked for something so drastic.

Second visit - we decided to visit again (shocking!) ONLY purely because of the food and AGAIN the service was just as the same. Tall guy with dark hair with a sweater saw us walking out and NOT EVEN a thank you whatsoever. Also, their masala chai was disgusting sorry to say, tasted like it came from a packet but chai latte was nice.

I was considering giving a 2 star‚≠êÔ∏è for the food BUT this goes to show that experience matters more sometimes. The only welcoming or friendly person there is probably the lady who delivers the food thats it!

Never going back here again and don‚Äôt recommend it to anybody. Dear owner, do better at training your staff about customer service - especially in a place like EALING, where competition is on a rise."

No frills, diner like atmosphere. We got there right before the line got too long but you can expect a wait. Moves pretty quick though. I was nervous by the time we ordered there wouldn't be seating but this place is efficient.

The queue was still just outside the entrance and I waited in line to see what all the attention was about.  I realized I had stumbled upon a landmark business which serves a variety of homestyle dishes alongside fast friendly service in a cute art deco atmosphere.
I opted for the daily special the braised steak and it did not disappoint.  The man behind the counter serving up dishes remembered my name and bid me farewell.  It was an excellent experience and one I recommend you try while in London."

I also ordered the harsh browns. They accept cards. The cafe is clean and tidy, and you don't have to wait long before a seat is available. They have many Latinos working in the kitchen so you'll be OK if your English is not so good. Shout out to Jenny from Bolivia, who was very cleaning the tables very quickly after customers left the cafe. Tourists and locals come to this cafe. Highly recommended."

The bolognese and cheddar was nice.
It is interesting there were a fair amount of grated carrots which were not bad.

There was 4 of us 2 of which were children. We ordered 2 items from the kids menu ‚Ä¢eggs, beans, sweetcorn and ‚Ä¢ Tuna roll.
Sadly the kids items were abit disappointing as the sweetcorn was frozen and the beans were luke
warm as if it were sitting out for too long. The tuna roll was ok.
Also the glasses we drank out of smelt very fishy/damp.

Service wasn't too bad polite friendly welcomed with smiles.

It had hotel guests working in the bar area which makes for an odd atmosphere. The bar looks nice but service was poor. To charge ¬£1.50 service automatically to your bill when they can‚Äôt serve an overpriced cocktail correctly is annoying. We stayed for one drink. There is outside seating for summer.

However the selection of savory was kind of  bland, tasteless. Selection of sweets were delicious. Service was quite slow and at the end we couldn't find restaurant staff at all and the person from the hotel said ""I have no idea we're staff of the restaurant is"" which was frustrating. At the end he thankfully was able to help us out with the bill.

Fun fact, at the outside chalkboard the price of the Afternoon Tea was ¬£37 and on the menu ¬£35. Thankfully ¬£35 was charged."

London,cafe,Cafe 1001,ChIJcwCeFbYcdkgRlPGrpXVrFBo,"91 Brick Ln, London",4.2,Kristin K,"Cafe 1001 is cool, like old-school cool.  Not just in the hip, relevent, millenial way, but it has the feel reminiscent of my days bumming around Seattle when I was a fine young thing. So what am talking about my friends is, vibe.  If ever there was a place with a vibe Cafe 1001 has it in spades.  I love things that do double duty, like a Murphy bed.  Sometimes such things can fall flat on their faces--like the mullet (ain't nobody ever going to convince me that a mullet is any kind of good stylistic choice, I grew up in the Land of the Mullet).  But in the case of Cafe 1001 it's a place that does double-duty as a coffee shop and a local musical space, and like the the former Sit 'n' Spin in Seattle (laundromat and music venue) I am down with that.

The interior is comfortable and features some cool artwork on the walls. It was a chill hangout and it would be a great place to hang with your friends, pretend to work on your laptop, smooch with your sweetie, or write the next great novel.  In any case, drop by and enjoy some coffee or some great local tunes."

I only had a couple of coffees and a slice of the apple crumb cake but boyyyyyy was that enough to tell me the quality of food was top!
Next time I‚Äôll probably order food food, because every plate that went past me looked great. I ordered at the bar and the staff were so friendly and made me feel comfortable which sometimes isn‚Äôt the standard for some cafes in the city.
The atmosphere is perfect for studying, catching up with friends or even having a few drinks. Just a great all round vibe and I look forward to going back!"

However, I ordered the typical English breakfast, and it took a good while to arrive. The mushroom was very tasty, but only one mushroom was served, so I longed for more. The sausage was too greasy for me. The bacon was tasty. The homemade beans were good and unique, I think they had bell pepper blended in them. Although this was probably the most flavorful English breakfast I‚Äôve had in England so far, I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get it again due to those points.

My companion got the nutella pancakes, which were incredibly fluffy and tasty.

The honey latte wasn‚Äôt strong enough for
my taste but I appreciated it the barista made it not too sweet for me. It tasted good to my companion who isn‚Äôt a coffee drinker though."

No Wifi Available:
I saw people with computers and thought that they had Wifi available but they mentioned that they do not share the Wifi‚Ä¶
I was seeking for wifi because I do not live in London and can‚Äôt use my phone as a hot spot. As a remote worker I like to find spots to send a few emails while eating lunch, if you work remote I just recommend bringing your hot spot with you. (They do have a sign that says no laptops on weekend, just as an FYI)

Avocado Toast:
I thought it was good although a bit bland to my liking I would have added a bit of herbs/seasoning (oregano, salt, pepper..) but that might be a personal preference, salad was good and everything else was great otherwise :)"

Always reassuring when other customers were rail workers, police and from the church.

One full English breakfast, double sausage, cheese and egg muffin with a side of bubble and squeak.   Really tasty and the bubble and squeak took me back to my childhood.

Orange juice was freshly squeezed and coffee was lovely.

The eggs were overdone for one of the dishes too (it happens, no big deal but just all adds up). This combined with some pretty steep prices means it‚Äôs still a solid spot but depending on your needs, it may not be for you.

Every little thing is done well here, stir fried peppers, mushrooms, crispy and yolky fried eggs. Hash browns are golden and crispy. (You may wonder how one could get these things wrong, but a lot and most of the breakfast/brunch places are mediocre and underwhelming and I often feel I wish I had cooked it myself at home. )

Oat latte was nice too.
Amercicano was so much better, I think they must be using good coffee beans.

I recently discovered Nova , and I can't stop raving about it! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a friendly atmosphere that made me feel right at home. The staff here go above and beyond to make sure every customer has a great experience, treating you more like a friend than just another customer.

But let's talk about the burgers‚Äîabsolutely phenomenal! Each burger is crafted with care, using fresh, high-quality ingredients that you can taste in every bite. The buns are perfectly toasted, the patties are juicy and flavorful, and the toppings are always fresh and generously portioned. Whether you're a fan of classic cheeseburgers or more adventurous options, their menu has something for everyone.

I also appreciated the attention to detail, from the perfectly melted cheese to the crisp lettuce and ripe tomatoes. The fries are equally impressive‚Äîgolden, crispy, and seasoned to perfection. They offer a variety of sides and sauces, each one better than the last.

What truly sets nova  apart is their commitment to customer service. The staff are not only friendly but also knowledgeable about the menu, offering great recommendations and making sure you leave satisfied. It's clear that they take pride in what they do, and it shows in every aspect of the dining experience.

If you're in the area and craving a delicious burger in a welcoming environment, look no further than nova. It's become my go-to spot for comfort food, and I can't wait to return. Highly recommended!

see you soon thank you !"

Came here twice, the first time with an amazing Salmon salad and also a Halloumi hashbrown wrap. Absolutely delicious!!
However that time had another dish that was overcooked, the lady understood us and gave a credit for next time. So I was determined to come again! Sometimes errors may have occurred once out of 1,000,000 but it's always the service that saves through it and the lady does just that

The next week we came for an all day brekkie and delicious egg avocado cream cheese on brown toast!! üíØüíØüíØabsolutely delicious. Also they serve great fresh coffee ‚òïÔ∏è

It's quite a packed shop but you know that is definitely a good thing."

Food was good, maybe a bit on the pricey side for what you get yet totally still within reason. Staff was within expectation for the type of place, nothing extraordinary but definitely not rude nor disrespectful like some of the other reviews state.

Overall a solid place if you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Great place to grab a bite to eat and a couple of pints in the evening sun."

Most recently had lunch here around midday on a Saturday. The service was prompt and friendly. The food was pretty decent overall we had a fry up, hot dog and watermelon/mint/cucumber salad. Prices are about average. The food probably isn‚Äôt exciting enough to bring me back frequently, but it‚Äôs a nice place to eat now and then given the great location on Broadway Market."

Very refreshing smoothie, tasty coffee and would recommend the poached eggs, avocado and salmon. The eggs were perfectly cooked, only thing that was a little odd was they were cold (otherwise I would have given 5 *s).  Maybe that's just the way they serve them?  Delicious regardless, and perfectly runny.  Would recommend."

A short walk away from the hustle of Columbia Flower market, you can find yourself a cosy spot inside (or out should the weather permit) this cafe serving up banging brekkies from full English to Turkish style. Get your 5 a day with the fresh smoothies whilst surrounded with autographs from a range of artists because the back has a recording studio!
The cafe's handwritten receipts give that retained old cafe feel.
People are rotating in and out so it's a great spot to people watch (or food watch) where lunch menu is also available."

The music, the coffee, the music studio, the warm staff which is all a family. All these factors combined give you the most wholesome and pleasurable experience. I am someone who really appreciates good background music and great people and here I met one of the best guys in all London, his name is Ozan and if you‚Äôre ever interested in visiting this amazing place I‚Äôll hope you‚Äôll be lucky enough to be served by him.

That it has truly delicious food that transfers you back home, an atmosphere and vibe that you feel you are in another century where having a coffee with an artist sitting next to you was normal and the prices are very very reasonable, are facts. But for me was its people; Ali and his family -work or not- created a safe and welcoming space for me to go every morning have my coffee, read my book and have a chat. Their centre of operation was their customers and the service was heartwarming! They really made my last months in London feel like I was at home and that last comp breakfast and motherly hug will stay with me forever. Thank you thank you thank you! So long and thanks for all the love. Say hi to Tom from me."
London,cafe,Premises Cafe & Bistro,ChIJzz1yTL8cdkgR7DWcN5egrDg,"209 Hackney Rd, London",4.8,Yasmin Chowdhury,"Despite the four star review, I would come back here. I just don‚Äôt think I ordered well, and would still like to try more of the food.
We ordered the fajitas and the vegetarian full English. Fajitas were good, the full English was pretty average. No part of it was particularly good, every element was just fine, a bit disappointing. Drinks were very good though, we had an iced coffee and a vanilla milkshake. The milkshake was actually great, there aren‚Äôt a lot of places that do a classic milkshake well, would definitely recommend.
The service was very good, although we were given the bill the moment our plates were cleared, and before we‚Äôd finished our drinks. But I‚Äôll chalk that up to the waiters been busy with the brunch rush.
The ambience in the restaurant was great, it was lovely and busy, without being too loud or claustrophobic.
Including tip, it came to just under ¬£40 for two drinks and two mains."

Each bite of their scrumptious avocado toast, accompanied by fluffy scrambled eggs, is a delightful experience. Their green smoothies are a refreshing complement, packed with vibrant, fresh flavors that invigorate the senses. And the coffee? Simply the freshest and most aromatic you‚Äôll find in the area.

What truly sets this bistro apart, though, is its impeccable service. The staff‚Äôs sincere hospitality makes you feel right at home, turning a simple meal into a memorable dining experience. Whether you‚Äôre a local or just passing through, this spot is well worth a visit."

The cafe's warm and inviting atmosphere, combined with its art-filled decor, made for a very pleasant experience.

The salad was fresh, colorful, and incredibly delicious. The quality and harmony of the ingredients were evident in every bite. Particularly, the avocado and pomegranate seeds in the salad created a perfect balance in terms of both flavor and texture. Additionally, the light and flavorful dressing complemented the salad perfectly.

Artist Cafe's carefully prepared dishes and charming ambiance make it well worth a visit. If you ever find yourself in Shoreditch, I highly recommend trying their salads."

I like their cinnamon rolls. 7¬£ for 2 which it‚Äôs very expensive but once in a while I guess it‚Äôs worth it.

Downside: they take forever to serve you. If you are not in a rush I guess that‚Äôs ok but every time I come here it takes forever to get the food. I‚Äôm guessing because there are only 2 people working here and sometimes it gets quite busy. Also it‚Äôs expensive!"

The food is all homemade by an amazing host (Lina). She worked away on her own providing a beautiful array of teas, pastries, cakes, sandwiches and finished off by a final course of scones and specialist jams (wasn‚Äôt even expecting the scone course).
They all tasted amazing, catering for both the veggies - with their own platter - and the meat eaters with our own.
It was all very special, delicate rich flavours, great tea and warm welcoming service.
We can‚Äôt speak highly enough of how great the experience was and the hard work and passion of Lina really shows through. She deserves all the success in the world and we will certainly be back.

Still a few things to improve but we are lucky to have them here. Much loved friendly local park cafe by the kids playgrounds alongside popular walks. Enough indoor seating. Plenty of outdoor seating both in front and at the back. Need a little more attention to what goes inside what they serve: example, avocado in my bagel wasn‚Äôt 100%. Otherwise, portions are generous and the food is fresh. Staff is attentive and welcoming. Coffee is good. Ice cream is excellent. Selection of off-the-shelf snacks is fun. Sweet treats are great variety and we always buy too many, because they look so good! Shame they shut their toilets to discourage all the walkers by from using them but hope they can come up with a better solution than that.

The sandwiches, cakes and scones were so fresh and tasty. Plenty of tea/coffee & hot choc constantly refilled! The staff were friendly and really helpful with dietary requirements.

The atmosphere was elegant and inviting, creating the perfect setting for a leisurely afternoon. The selection of teas was extensive, catering to every taste, and each cup was brewed to perfection. The tiered trays of sandwiches, scones, and pastries were not only beautifully presented but also absolutely delicious. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply indulging in a treat, I highly recommend this charming tea lounge for a memorable experience."
London,tea house,The St. Ermin's Tea Lounge,ChIJCwl5B9wEdkgRTeaTBFmWv7o,"Caxton St, London",4.6,Bree M,"We enjoyed our afternoon tea. We booked about a week in advance. The scones with clotted cream and jam- both regular and the gluten free- were the Highlight- soft and warm and filling.
The room is lovely and I like the flower motif chandeliers. The chairs were comfortable and they did a nice job accommodating my gluten allergy (celiac) . I got an equal amount of food as my non-gf spouse.
My favorite teas were the vanilla rooibos and the mango. My husband‚Äôs favorite were the Bora Bora (very fruity) and the Chai.
The bathroom downstairs was very clean and well-appointed with lotion, hand towels as well as dryers.
The improvement area could be that we had to wait awhile to order and several of the sweet items my husband received on his regular platter should be naturally gluten free, such as French macarons, so it‚Äôs kinda weird they don‚Äôt just bake all of those in the gf kitchen and then bring those needed in the regular kitchen when necessary.
We also didn‚Äôt care for a couple of the sandwiches- my husband doesn‚Äôt care for cheese and there was a cheese sandwich and although I normally like ham and roast beef, I didn‚Äôt enjoy either of those sandwiches, and the gf carrot cake was dry and terrible. They should try the gf recipethat‚Äôs made with pineapple for added moisture."
London,tea house,Bond St. Tea Rooms,ChIJHafnNNMadkgRwUwBgJyH0YA,"350 Oxford St, London",4.4,L U,"Not an authentic afternoon tea experience. If you are visiting England/ UK, and looking to try out afternoon tea, please please avoid this place. This is not correct afternoon tea. Its not necessarily terrible. It‚Äôs just not afternoon tea.

-You only get to pick 2x savoury items and 2x items from the sweet section. That‚Äôs all. In a correct afternoon tea experience, if there are 4x kinds of sandwiches on the menu, you will be served all 4 of them. Also, there are definitely more than 2x savoury items in any other afternoon tea places.

-They don‚Äôt give you any seconds/ refills. A standard for any afternoon tea is they come back and offer more sandwiches and cakes.

-Instead of normal sandwiches, their savoury section consists mostly of general starter foods (fried courgettes, bruschetta, Caesar salad etc)

-They had no plain scone. They had scones with sultana and scones with chestnut, and scones with orange. Plain scone was not even on the menu. And again, you had to select two kinds of scones from the menu.

-One actual ‚Äòsandwich‚Äô I had, cucumber with cream cheese, was very dry. The bread was dry.

The variety of food you get to choose was disappointing. 2x items from savoury and sweet means that you only get to taste one kind of cake apart from a (let‚Äôs face it) mandatory scone. The overall quantity of food was disappointing. The quality of the food was also disappointing. The one real ‚Äòsandwich‚Äô I had was very dry as I mentioned above. The other starter I had, fried courgettes was fine.

I had some sense of closure when, upon leaving the hotel, I saw an Italian restaurant on the ground floor. I looked at their menu and found a good number of the same items offered in the ‚Äòafternoon tea‚Äô dining area upstairs. They essentially serve the same food from the same kitchen and package them differently upstairs. Operationally, it makes sense. It makes an efficient production line. But to call this ‚Äòafternoon tea‚Äô is a massive stretch. Essentially, this ‚Äòafternoon tea‚Äô area is an afterthought to the existing Italian restaurant downstairs."

Is it the best catering I‚Äôve ever had in my life? No. Is it worth the price? Absolutely! Compared to other high priced afternoon tea venues in London, I have to say this is a very good value. I‚Äôm not sure about refill because the staff didn‚Äôt proactively offer so I did not bother asking."

The tea was lovely and served in individual pots, we had the lavender earl grey and the cherry rose sencha, and the food was delectable and perfectly portioned. The pastries were so delicious that we purchased extras to enjoy later!

The atmosphere was cozy, and even the restroom was pristine. With so much to explore in London, we‚Äôll definitely return on our next visit. Booking a month in advance was necessary and entirely worth it.

Thank you Eamon and the rest of the staff for this warm welcome to London! Your recommendation for clotted cream first and jam second was perfection.

This was our first visit in London and I wanted to try afternoon tea - when in London right?! I booked a reservation about a month before our trip. It‚Äôs a cute little place. The ambiance was pretty elegant. The classic afternoon tea was so worth the 25 pounds per person! It was a lot of food and all were delicious from the different sandwiches all the way up to the desserts. i loved the little tea cups with the cute teapot and the cute sugar cubes! It seems that the place was always busy but the staff was friendly and very attentive. It was a great experience. For the price and what you get it‚Äôs definitely worth it!

I recommend the Shichuan grand cumin Lamb strips and the Barbecued lamb. They are amazing and have a very large quantity, I was over full.

I'm sure most people of African or Caribbean descent would love the Shichuan grand cumin Lamb strips because it tastes exactly like African 'suya' meat and it's quite spicy.

The sandwich selection was very good, the scones were divine. Sandwiches included coronation tofu and seitan. However, there was an issue with the second round of sandwiches containing something they shouldn't - a small mix up in the kitchen, I assume. The duty manager dealt with this in an efficient and professional way. The level of customer care from her was outstanding (unsure of her name but she had perfect winged eyeliner!) She wouldn't even let us pay the service charge in the end although we did leave a tip. Although it was a small blip it was an important one which she recognised. The only other negative was my husband wasn't asked if he wanted any more tea, whereas I was brought hot water for a top up automatically. None of this would stop us recommending it. The tea room staff were very, very good. Shame the same can't be said of some of the ground floor till staff!"

The staff were very attentive and it had a calm atmosphere. The cakes on the top tier were divine but the middle tier seemed shop-bought. The sandwiches were a little too small also. Overall it was lovely.

I booked afternoon tea via Wowcher, the booking was a struggle itself. Nobody answered the phone for days and responded to me email. Finally after my second email, I've got my booking confirmation. Went there, receptionist didn't greet us or treat us as customers, just kept quiet. We were taken to the ""tea room"" which was closed from the outside for visitors, was served awful looking sandwiches with finger prints on them, cold and hard scones and cookies. Left the place without touching none of the food, it was simply disgusting. This place should be taken off Wowcher. Waste of time and money."

London,tea house,Putney Tea Room,ChIJy_t1QuAPdkgRXXtaycsrfDc,"214 Upper Richmond Rd, London",4,Dani Miltiades,"My husband and I went on a gift voucher on valentines day for afternoon tea...
This was suppose to be in the hotel, however when we got there we were ushered into the cafe next door.
We were give a table and asked if we wanted drinks.
I ordered cappuccino and my husband tea.
We asked for English tea. When it arrived it was very weak and tasted like dish water.

After a short while the lady came back to give us our sandwiches.
We were not asked if we wanted white or brown bread. There was no option as to what fillings we could choose.
The sandwiches where not presented well at all. The filling was extremely minimal (mayo and tuna) No cucumber or sweetcorn. The ham and cheese was the thinested uou could imagine. Also it was clear the sandwiches had been either made the night before or very early morning.

We had four small stail scones that were not fresh. Accompanied by a few other cakes these too where not up to scratch.

All in all the experience was disappointing. We was asked if everything was OK and I said no and explained and the lady just said she was sorry about that.

Certainly won't be recomending the putney tea rooms to anyone.
Considering this was valentines days the atmosphere was non existent  and not one rose In site...
Very disappointing"

The shop is clean and every cup of tea is incredibly flavorful. I ordered ""Fireworks Cool Easily,"" and it was quite impressive! It's a perfect place for a short break during your travels.

However, as delightful as it is, The Tastea does feel somewhat similar to other tea spots around the city. While it excels in providing a classic, satisfying tea experience, it doesn't quite have that extra spark to make it stand out from the crowd.

That being said, if you find yourself nearby with a craving for tea, The Tastea is definitely worth a visit. The friendly staff, the inviting vibe, and the delicious drinks all come together to create a lovely little haven for tea lovers."

There was a party of twelve of us.

The proprietor of this vintage heaven also made all the sandwiches, fresh on the day and I was pleased to say, she also catered for myself, with a food disease and allergies, brilliantly!

The sandwiches and mini cakes, melted in the mouth and with almost endless pots of tea, if required - the setting and atmosphere, was just perfect.

Tea Island was busy with other smaller parties going on, but, and we all sang Happy Birthday, to other strangers and shared in their celebration too.

Definitely a place I would happily re-visit for another celebration, or even, just for afternoon tea.

A lovely, traditional looking tea shop, in a beautiful location. Very accommodating and friendly staff. Teas are presented in nice crockery, as is the food. Plenty of choice of cold drinks (and nice quality fruit based ones) as well as sodas and hot drinks. But the star of the show for me is the owners beautiful homemade cakes, with new bakes often added, so you can try all sorts of great desserts. Very nice freshly prepared sandwiches-always better then the pre-packaged ones many places serve up.

A further nice touch is the bags of food provided for feeding the ducks with, water for dogs, and colouring for the kids.

Its nice to have a place like this to sit down for something to eat and drink after a walk around Langtons park, but also more then worth travelling too!

Well done team on a great job!"

London,tea house,Mariage Freres,ChIJtXo-ZMwEdkgRoNln_Qd9idU,"38 King St, London",4.3,Lily,"10/10 would not recommend. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.

This was the most uninspired place I‚Äôve ever dined at in the UK. If I could give 0 stars for service I would, because there was absolutely none. I guess we should‚Äôve expected it when the entire restaurant was empty in the afternoon.

All their wait staff were stood around outside near the bar chit chatting the entire time we were there. Aside from taking our order and serving our food, we had barely any other interaction with them. Neither did our waitress deign to introduce the tea jams she brought, simply plopping them down and walking off.

We watched the table behind us struggle to pick a tea from the menu, and the wait staff similarly struggled to provide any sort of recommendations or information about their teas. I‚Äôve never seen such lacklustre service in my life.

When I popped down to the first floor to check out their teas and products, I was met with the same non-existent service. Staff were simply standing around chit chatting even though we made eye contact so I know they knew I was there.

We ordered the brunch set, which came with a choice of ice cream, a patisserie, or two mini gateaux. They never bothered to ask what we would like, and we had to inquire after sitting awkwardly for a while, before walking ourselves over to the glass display on our own and request to order. Our waitress also did not bother to inform us that we could pick other desserts than the gateaux, and I only remembered after they‚Äôd served up the food. She also failed to introduce the different gateaux available and we had to clarify twice.

The food itself wasn‚Äôt great either. I‚Äôve had much better food in other tea houses both in and outside of the UK. It definitely was not worth the price we paid.

The final straw was the number of drain flies buzzing around the tables during our meal. I would not recommend any one to come to this place, ever."

The line of people waiting to get a table is strong testament to the decades of quality of service at this place.

There are nothing fancy or instagrammable here if that is what you want when you eat a breakfast or brunch. There are only well made British breakfasts, sandwiches and tea cakes. Whether you need a full English or a single cream tea, this place will guarantee a fulfilling meal for anyone, even someone like me who don't care for breakfast at all.

My only issue was that the the staff messed up the coffee order we placed and brought a normal coffee when my wife had asked for decaf cappuccino and that woukd have caused issues for her had he unknowingly drank it. The staff apologised quickly for that oversight and replaced drink. Also the muffin  I had ordered was toasted a bit too much making it hard to cut into with a fork.

Nonetheless we had a happy experience and I will definitely have this place in my list of places that I will visit again and again."

Positives: lovely scones and tea and setting inside. Sandwiches are just ok - bread is soft and fresh but see below

Negatives:
any of the other food that comes in the afternoon tea - the cakes are cheap, cream cakes that taste of nothing.
Sandwiches - just ok, but a little tasteless

By far though and the reason why I will not visit again is the waiting staff (everyone I encountered from asking for a table, for a menu when seated and then the bill) are extremely rude and dismissive. Like a previous reviewer, they made me feel like we were an inconvenience by being a customer. You can tell they are talking about customers (in a non complimentary way) in front of them in another language and it‚Äôs just unacceptable."

Such a hidden gem that I definitely recommend a visit to. We had the afternoon tea with the homemade carrot cake jam and it was to die for. We will definitely be returning.

The friendliness of the staff, the amazing cakes (totally recommend the blueberry and lemon cake) and being able to sit outside by the ponds makes for a gorgeous time.
Unfortunately the ponds are going to be closes for a couple of months, but they also have the most cozy and charming garden inside the Manor. And if you visit from Thursday to Saturday you can even visit the Honeywood Manor."

Lovely little tea room, although a coffee is ¬£4.20! Nice food. Freshly prepared. Bathroom could do with a deep clean but perfectly serviceable. If it's raining, there are only 8 seats inside, so it's definitely a good weather venue. Right next door to Honeywood Museum, which is open Thur - Sat."

Perfect place to visit on a sunny day to enjoy the garden centre. Food portions are on the small side, and it's not the cheapest, but I couldn't fault the quality."
London,tea house,Petersham Nurseries Teahouse Richmond,ChIJqXpfmBQMdkgRLTFvDCvZvjk,"Off Church Lane, Petersham Rd, Richmond",4.3,Aisha T,"Review for Caffe:

Caffe is a wonderful place to spend on a sunny day. The spacious indoor seating and charming nursery provide ample opportunity to relax and explore

The food was quite good during our visit for brunch and cream tea.

The letdown was the service. We had to wait nearly 30 minutes to order even simple items like a fork. The staff seemed disinterested and their attitudes were quite poor.

When we briefly walked through the tearoom, we encountered similarly aloof and unhelpful service from the staff. It was an unpleasant interaction.

Overall, Caffe has a nice atmosphere and setting."

We were seated outside as requested, and ordered a litre of fresh lemonade. I had a baked potato and trout, which while delicious, was old and had eyes in the potato which was a little off putting. The rest of the food was great. It's quite pricey, but very popular and extremely busy. A lovely day out"
London,tea house,Petersham Nurseries Teahouse Richmond,ChIJqXpfmBQMdkgRLTFvDCvZvjk,"Off Church Lane, Petersham Rd, Richmond",4.3,Sarah Coulson,"Honestly, we came away a bit deflated. The food was nice, but at those prices, I expected nicer.

We had to ask for some items several times, even once watched our food be put down at another table, saw the guests tell the wait staff out wasn't theirs and then had it brought over. We were told that they had run out of the Haye Farm Beef Burger - a real shame - onky to see at least a dozen being served in the hours we sat there, so clearly it was available.

I was also disappointed that my potatoes and herbs were lacking the cream cheese and garlic (as shown in my photo), the butter given with the sourdough bead barely coated two half slices (spread thinly) and the portion of Trofie Pasta we received was more like that of a child's portion compared to the table next to us. It was such a shame. The only item I would compliment was the Spinach, Goats Cheese & Sundried Tomatoes Quiche, which was delixious and a good size. We waited a long time (over 20 minutes) to receive our cakes (2 of the chocolate orange ones) and then with the service charge at the end we'd feel too awkward to take off, it just left a bit of a sour taste.

I would return to the Garden centre, but certainly not the cafe."

We we're meant to sit outside but sadly it started to rain, so they moved us into a beautiful green house. They were very attentive, we had quite a few dietary requirements which they sorted with no problem. The food was lovely and we were stuffed by the end.

I would highly recommend this as a venue."

All of them are just mildly sweet, especially the highly-seasoned matcha latte with authentic pure matcha powder from Jeju Island, Korea and the melty feeling on your tongue when biting Korean honey biscuit and Japanese crepes.

Had a lovely English breakfast and a pot of tea. Food was served in good time. The teapot had a tea cozy. Nice relaxing atmosphere. The place was decorated to a high standard. Very clean throughout.

Staff were friendly and polite. They were very efficient but not rushing around looking chaotic.

Once you're in there it's hard to believe you're still in Romford, more like Upminster.

How could they improve? I'd suggest warmed up plates for the food.

Highly recommend this place."

Today we was completely disappointed. I ask for poached egg got fried . Was told I can keep it and she get me another one on a separate plate . For me that wasn‚Äôt for me as I really hate the smell/look /taste of Fried egg so to be left on my plate I had to say no. The bacon was barely cooked and the toast was still like bread. Seemed to have been rushed cooked and all undercooked. I got a frosted look when I asked for it to be changed. The food is not cheap so I have the right to have it spot on but to be honest I would have got better  quality in the greasy spoon cafe and better service . Sorry can only be honest.

I had the gluten free option for the afternoon tea, yet the main issue was the bread. There was nothing special with the sandwiches, while the bread tasted like store bought, the feeling was a bit basic and bland with not much to offer. I was unable to eat the cakes/scone as they were too sweet and dense, respectively.

It was an okay experience and would not come back. Mainly because you achieve a similar experience at home or buying a meal deal and a store bought cake."

Clare was responsive and enthusiastic from the initial enquiry, talking me through the options and what can and can‚Äôt be done.

We decided on a carrot cake which was beautifully decorated with cream cheese frosting and flowers by Kathryn.

My partner Cece was over the moon with it and I have to say the cake was delicious. Don‚Äôt tell my mum but it was better than hers!

I will not hesitate to recommend or use Clare and Willow Bough in the future. For anything cake or catering related. Her and the team are top notch."

Myself and my partner were left in a state of blissful satisfaction with full stomachs and broad spread smiles across our faces!

The afternoon tea set came with everything you would expect, the cakes were fresh, the scones were mouthwatering and we both struggled to speak for quite some time due to the pace at wish we found ourselves gobbling it all up.

London,tea house,Afternoon Tea at The Montague on The Gardens,ChIJcz_X1zMbdkgRY90Ob_7ln-A,"15 Montague St, London",4.2,Joy Shang,"*this is solely for the service; food was excellent*
I had booked the ultimate champagne afternoon tea as the highlight to end my vacation, but was sorely disappointed.

There was confusion (mostly on my part) upon check-in regarding a deposit, but it was simply to hold a card in case of no-shows. The service started off great, but was gradually became infrequent. 50 minutes into my seating, I was in need of a refill of hot water for my tea, water, and my champagne (which the latter I would have been fine with not acknowledging). I was glanced past multiple times with a visible empty glass of water and tea pot until I requested the server in passing coming back from the bathroom to ask for refills of liquids, as well as sandwiches, as unlimited food is supposed to be included with the experience. The next time I was checked on was a little past the time limit (30+ minutes later), and proceeded to wait another 40+ minutes until a shift change occurred where a new server finally checked in on me (well past my 90 minute window). I asked if I could have one more glass of champagne since I hadn‚Äôt been checked on for a long time, and overheard the manager upset, yet not checking on me to inform me himself or ask for context as to why I still hadn‚Äôt been checked out. I was reassured by the new server that I shouldn‚Äôt have needed to walk to the bar to ask for service because I apologized thinking I needed to rather than waiting like a sitting duck the past 40 minutes like a fool at my table. She apologized as clearly there was miscommunication with the staff regarding zoning handoff during their shift changes. This review is not based on her. If anything, she was a relief to finally provide context so I could ask for the check and finally leave.

With the already included gratuity, this experience is NOT WORTH whatsoever. To clarify, this review isn‚Äôt about how much ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù I received during my reservation, but that the service was severely lacking the further into my reservation time it got. I knew it was well past my time, but I felt horribly unwelcomed by what I overheard and wanted to leave as soon as I could after paying my bill, but the service charge is wholly not deserved, let alone the initial price. I would have contested the service charge had I not already felt mortified and uncomfortable about staying at my table any longer than necessary. It left a terrible taste in my mouth to the end of my vacation, and I am genuinely upset to have wasted 184¬£ and my time on this afternoon tea experience. I do not recommend!"
London,tea house,Afternoon Tea at The Montague on The Gardens,ChIJcz_X1zMbdkgRY90Ob_7ln-A,"15 Montague St, London",4.2,James Reeves,"I loved our visit here for afternoon tea. I booked a table for my missus and I for her birthday and was looking for a good spot near the dominion theatre that was close enough to walk.

The staff were very welcoming and in my opinion, treated us like royalty. We felt important from the moment we arrived. We were seated in the lobby which was decorated tastefully vintage and then shown to our table in a segregated area of the tearooms.

The fresh earl grey tea for a start was the best we've ever tasted and we're considering buying a tea infuser and the leaves they used to replicate at home.

Food was served in regular intervals and was very tasteful. Didn't know a cucumber sandwich could be so tasty. The selection of these and cakes was the great. Lots to try. We thought we'd be hungry afterwards, but we had to take some home in a box.

The vibe was relaxed, we could see the gardens through the window behind us we had an all round pleasant afternoon. Thank you Montague!"

London,tea house,Afternoon Tea at The Rubens,ChIJO9Ur3yAFdkgRe-0j5x-ZC88,"39 Buckingham Palace Rd, London",4.7,Sarah Freia,"I thoroughly enjoyed my afternoon tea dining experience at The Rubens at the Palace.

The charming-yet-whimsical dining space overlooks Buckingham Palace. I found it fun to people watch as I drank my tea. I also appreciated the live piano music. One thing thing I want to point out is the seating! While there were traditional look-into-each-others-eyes style tables, there were also couch-style seats (pictured) which were a rather pleasant way to share food.

As a gluten free individual, it can be tricky to get access to good quality scones, and thoughtfully prepared patisseries. Fortunately for me, both were in order on the menu. While the scones were slightly less fluffy than what I usually favour, they were still delicious. They also paired beautifully with the raspberry jam (a standout), clotted cream, and delightful lemon curd. Honestly, that stuff was stupendous. As an added bonus, there was even a savoury cheese scone. The patisseries were fun, rich, and inventive. If you prefer more traditional desserts, rather than fruity and fresh concoctions, they may not be to your liking. However, I really enjoyed them. Especially that mango cake thing... Wow. I had 6.

I need to explicitly highlight the superb service. Angelina went above and beyond to ensure our meal was nothing short of excellent. She didn't even comment or bat an eye when I ordered multiple scone refills (and I had a total of 12... seriously). If you're lucky enough to have her during your dining experience, consider yourself lucky.

In short, The Rubens is an excellent place to choose for your afternoon tea. There is attention to detail all around, and I highly recommend it!"
London,tea house,Afternoon Tea at The Rubens,ChIJO9Ur3yAFdkgRe-0j5x-ZC88,"39 Buckingham Palace Rd, London",4.7,Josh Jayasinghe,"I went for afternoon tea with my mum and it was incredible. To start, the service by Kamal and his team makes for a welcoming and warm experience. They source their tea selection from Sri Lanka, and there are many teas to choose from with the option to try as many teas as you like. These are teas that you won't easily find elsewhere, so well worth drinking a few.

The sandwiches were fresh and delicious, with the option to ask for extras of any sandwiches. They also have vegan and vegetarian options which should be requested at booking to guarantee availability. The fresh scones, jams and clotted cream were also some of the best I have had and again you can ask for extra if you have room still. The cake selection was unique and delicious - I don't think I have had cakes like it before. Whatever you cannot finish you can take home, along with a selection of sweets at the exit. I would recommend not eating breakfast to fully enjoy the experience. On weekends I believe they also have a live piano player. I would describe the ambience as classy but friendly and relaxed. It is an afternoon tea experience well worth the price!"

The scones were warm, fluffy, infused with raisins and I also got a carrot cake which was one of the best I ever tried and a warm cup of Earl Gray tea with it.

Firstly I cannot fault the staff as they were all genuinely warm and welcoming. As for the ambience, it was nice but a pretty small space so you can hear everything that guests from the other tables are saying. As for the food, it took approximately 40 minutes after we were seated for it to make an appearance. The scones were served warm. The sandwiches were all very underwhelming. Pity! Also we were not offered refills (usually in places where the Afternoon Tea costs ¬£50 and above, the hosts would explain and also mention that they offer refills). The salmon sandwich was inedible, it smelled so fishy and was served cold in a seeded dense slice of bread. One bite and I had funny vibes about it so I didn‚Äôt eat more of it.

The staff is super nice and friendly but unfortunately the cakes were dry and not that great.  The salmon sandwich was the truly best but the rest was just ok.  It is not really worth the price charged.  They don't even bother with fresh jam but standard hotel prepackaged jams. The room is in the basement, small but nicely decorated and there is sufficient natural light.

Check in was delightfully easy  with the friendly shop team, and judging by the key box outside the entrance door, a late check in was also possible if needed.
When we were shown to our room, it was beautiful! A well kept room with a stunning interior. Charming vintage notes around the place to tie in with the decor of the shop. The small chair with the roses was my favourite. The bed mattress was super comfortable and the bedding was exquisite! The room had everything we possibly need - mini fridge, fan, iron and ironing board, safe etc.. The bathroom was clean, bright and spacious.

We arrived around half past 10 in the morning and was told they'll soon start to prepare for the lunch rush. Reasonable given that we didn't have a reservation. The lady was managing both the tables and incoming diners, so it got busy quickly. We saw a table of customers walked out after 20 mins or so (guessed the lady was too busy to take their order).

We got our orders in just fine and the food arrived within the expected time frame. The quiches were delicious but I remember regretting my decision of ordering the ham one after trying my family's mushroom and salmon quiches. The ham quiche was on the saltier side. The desserts and teas were quite good.

What put me off was when we received the bill...the quiches didn't have price labels on them, so it could have been that, but the total came much higher than we expected, given that we ordered 4 quiches, 2 desserts and 4 pots of teas. It felt like a tourist trap.

Anyway, still would recommend this place, but make sure to get clear on prices from the start!"

Our group of 10 went there to celebrate a special Birthday. We didn‚Äôt get any fan fare through the presentation of the food. We saw bird cages, smokes and mirrors on Tik Tok and was underwhelmed by the lack of presentation for our group. The tea selection was the highlight of the day. Each of us got our own pretty pot of tea. The Traditional sandwiches and the Asian inspired food that came after were devastatingly bad. Worst experience of our entire trip. Waiter was gone most of the time and it takes him 30 mins to bring out hot water. The pictures below is exactly how they served our food. they spent 0 efforts in displaying it."

Strange seating set up and the big door that's not meant to be for use kept being used by staff so a number of us were feeling very cold. Good selection of teas. Excellent scones. Shame no matcha scone like on their online menu, they need to change this. One of four cakes has alcohol. Waitress said if I didn't want that it should have been declared. They said they have a non alcoholic version but they took all 4 away for some reason when I could have just enjoyed the three and waited for the other to arrive. Unfortunately it wasn't very good anyway. London has many excellent afternoon tea venues. This is not one of them."

The salon is not big, but it‚Äôs decorated tastefully and feels very royal-like. The staff was welcoming and very attentive, explaining every course with detail. The food was amazing. Great variety both savory and sweet with the best scones and mermelada I tasted. Perhaps the portions were a bit big considering all the food they offered but I suppose it‚Äôs better for them to be big rather than small. The entire experience is an absolute must if it‚Äôs your first visit in London."
London,tea house,The Rose Lounge,ChIJ7V2-D9EEdkgRvd_HIMCHgF4,"6 Waterloo Pl, London",4.5,Helena Bourmault,"Savoury Selection: 10/10 - Definitely among the highest quality in terms of 5-star afternoon tea in London. Can't tell if it's refillable as we¬†weren't offered the option, but we're both glad we didn't have a 2nd round, as they were themselves quite heavy not to mention the following courses were just as substantial.

Sweet Selection: 9/10 - Again, among the best for sure, but not the best we'd had. Also, each of them was of a decent size, unlike the very miniature style offered in some other hotels. Even the complimentary celebration cake tasted surprisingly good - it's a generous slice of dark chocolate mousse cake.

Scones: Shockingly disappointing. Store-bought scones in my pantry would have been so much better. Also, we thought we would get to try the rose jam, but were offered only a good old strawberry jam.

Tea: Pairing as indicated on the menu was fine. If you are a tisane person, however, only the most common peppermint, chamomile, lemon ginger, etc. are available.

Vibe: 10/10 - The interiors, tea set and plates were all stunningly rosy. No doubt an instagrammable experience.

Staff: 9/10 - Friendly staff, satisfactory service, though there were gaps where no one was around within the lounge when we needed something. They offered the anniversary cake, congratulated us, and were so helpful in taking some nice pictures for us.

It was not busy on a Sunday. We had our quiet, peaceful afternoon. Overall, we so very much enjoyed the experience. Recommended!"

London,tea house,The Rose Lounge,ChIJ7V2-D9EEdkgRvd_HIMCHgF4,"6 Waterloo Pl, London",4.5,Judith X,"One has to admit that this is the easiest afternoon tea to book at the last minute during Christmas in London. It's located in the Sofitel hotel. The location is good, right off Regent Street. However, the lounge itself is quite small, essentially serving as the hotel's lobby sitting area with about ten tables in total. For Christmas, they recommend the Christmas set, priced at ¬£70 (without champagne) and ¬£80 (with champagne), per person.

The tea, although fleet, is just tea bags, and I reckon the ones at my home might be better. The first savory course includes a salmon tart, two types of sandwiches, and a baked cheese sandwich; the second sweet course has about five desserts. They're not bad, but certainly not memorable.

The service staff are extremely busy throughout, quickly explaining the products and swiftly serving the meals, lacking the ceremonial feel of afternoon tea.

If you can book somewhere else, definitely don't choose this one. If you really can't book anywhere else, I suggest just going to any five-star hotel for tea and desserts, which would probably be more worthwhile and atmospheric. We later regretted not having tea at our hotel."

London,tea house,Mr Hamilton's Tea Room,ChIJmRG0GJzfdUgRb2zTTHwDLus,Cobham,3.8,James Hendry,"I don‚Äôt know where to start with what needs fixing here‚Ä¶ We arrived at 12:15 on a Saturday lunchtime to find that there were only 5 sandwiches in the fridge and only ONE in the children‚Äôs food fridge, which we bought for our daughter as there didn‚Äôt appear to be any other suitable options. I somehow gathered up all our bits and pieces (drinks, crisps etc) in my hands because all the trays were stuck behind the serving counter, and paid one of the staff who was super nice and polite. So far, okay.

Getting back to our table, I opened my daughter‚Äôs sandwich and just as I was about to feed it to her noticed that it was a day out of date- so, back to the counter where a different young lady stared blankly at me before agreeing to swap it for something else. But what? There apparently weren‚Äôt any more sandwiches on site - luckily at that exact moment someone came out of the kitchen with two baked potatoes for someone else, alerting me to the fact that there was other hot food available to order than what was sitting in the hot cabinet (chips, pasties and the saddest looking burger patties I‚Äôve ever seen.) There was no menu for this other hot food, and no prices anywhere, so I just had to accept that apparently the jacket was ¬£4.50 more expensive than the sandwich and pay up.

So we swapped the expired sandwich for a jacket potato with beans and cheese (which, to be fair, our daughter absolutely devoured - hence the two stars) and then opened our boxes containing our toasted sandwiches, only to find they were both burned on the outside and a good deal crunchier than presumably intended. Deciding it wasn‚Äôt worth complaining, we all ate up, and on the way out I spotted the only information about the fresh hot food, a small blackboard hidden behind a post.

Such a shame - the garden itself is great but the food and some of the service at this caf√© are really letting it down. I had never really considered just how good National Trust caf√©s are until today‚Ä¶"

London,tea house,The Honey Pot Cafe & Tea Rooms,ChIJs5rm_qRS30cRSd8CyIUBKzQ,"4 High St, Shoreham, Sevenoaks",4.6,Paul Komarek,"I arrived by bike 10 minutes before closing. Four others arrived just ahead of me for ice cream (there's wide selection of ice cream cups), and with 2 minutes before closing I hoped to get a sandwich.

Despite having already closed down their hot food kitchen, they improvised and made a very nice cheese and pickle sandwich for me and were happy to make tea for me as well. Under other circumstances I'd have ordered cake for afters, given how many delicious cakes they had available.

They also offered an outdoor spigot to refill my water bottles (twice, different employees) which suggests they were thinking about my situation without me asking. Finally, since they were closing they gave me one of their last bananas -- again, offered without me asking.

They only have a small garden and normally I don't think they can accommodate bikes inside. I'm not sure where else to park them (when you arrive 10 minutes before close and don't have time to look around), but in my case the garden had already emptied and they suggested I bring my bike in. I wouldn't expect this, and am sharing just because it (again) shows how attentive they are."

My friend and I were having a chat when a man in the cafe asked us to keep the noise down as ""he couldn't hear himself think"". Some of his group laughed as if it were a joke and his delivery was really rude. The staff who worked there, who were otherwise lovely, didn't say anything or acknowledge it as we were leaving. Later on a lady we bumped into walking apologised and said he was a local and just grumpy. It is people visiting Shoreham that keeps a lot of these business running. A small village could not sustain numerous pubs and cafes without them and being rude is just unncessary. Really disappointed as otherwise everyone we meet in Shoreham, be it walkers or local businesses have been really friendly. Sadly won't be returning here."
London,tea house,The Honey Pot Cafe & Tea Rooms,ChIJs5rm_qRS30cRSd8CyIUBKzQ,"4 High St, Shoreham, Sevenoaks",4.6,Billy Bob,"In response to the reply...

We were not playing a boardgame. Did you have a similar experience with someone who was?

Simply saying the opposite to what did happen, does not make it right. The gruff man still exists.

As the review noted, the manner was not polite. And a blatant lie: we were not told on entry that you closed at 4pm. If we were, we would have been far more aware of ourselves and made sure to leave at that time. I guess we could be forgiven for enjoying ourselves and losing track of time. If we were aware, and had failed to leave, then we would be bad customers. Whereas what actually happened was poor customer service, and one of those Instagram worthy non-apologies. Still, you had our money, so why else would you care? As mentioned before, at the time of paying I mentioned we were just about to finish up.

Hey-ho!

Such a shame... 3 adults visited on a Saturday, arriving just after 3pm.
The food was good for a village tea room.
Up until the last five minutes the experience did not warrant a review, but then, it all changed. Hopped up to pay at what was about 3.57pm, and said we'd be finishing up very soon, and was told not a problem.

Sat back down, followed by a gruff man who asked if we'd finished with the cutlery - I said we had. There were a few sips of tea left, but it was all whisked away. As he walked away he said they closed at 4 (this was the first we knew of closing time - no heads-up prior). It was a minute to 4, which we were unaware was ""throw out time"". No sooner had we processed it was actually closing time he came back and took away the last few bits ""doors are closed at 4"". Began closing the blinds, switching off the lights.

There's no greater way of making paying customers feel entirely unwelcome. We have your money. The doors must be shut at exactly 4pm. Off you pop! He hopped into a van promoting aerials, and we were left with quite a sour taste in our mouths.

I guess next time we'll go to the quaint little place across the street, with more charm, and less brashness.

Yes, people have off days. But good customer service pays, and it sticks.

Oh! They did seem to cater for people with dietary restrictions very well. Even had a printed ingredients list, to show what was in all their cakes."

London,tea,Lucky Tea,ChIJnbRZatsFdkgRitZ9nX9BYSc,"35 Newport Ct, London",4.7,R Al,"Edit: thank you for responding. She did indeed not recommend it but I tried the tea before mixing and in my opinion it was not sour as described. However, it‚Äôs always a risk when you ask someone for a recommendation so I‚Äôm not blaming her for recommending it. For her, this may taste sour so my judgment was just for the fixed sweetness level of the drink. I didn‚Äôt take the cheese topping flavour into account. Thanks for your offer for a free drink too. üëçüèº

Original review: I asked lady at the till for a recommendation for a sour drink that‚Äôs not too sweet. She recommended the grape tea or green grape tea for a more sour flavour so I went for the green. It‚Äôs fixed sweetness and ice which I‚Äôm not a fan of because it wasn‚Äôt cold enough and it was too sweet. It also wasn‚Äôt sour.  I added cream cheese but it wasn‚Äôt my favourite.

At the of the day, it can be hit and miss with these drinks so I like to try different places but it seems like this isn‚Äôt my kind of place. Hey! Tea is better for fruit flavours.

I have to comment that there was a customer with her dog on the table where customers sit to drink their tea and I find it crazy that the workers didn‚Äôt ask her to take it off. That‚Äôs beyond unsanitary.

The sandwich selection was very good, the scones were divine. Sandwiches included coronation tofu and seitan. However, there was an issue with the second round of sandwiches containing something they shouldn't - a small mix up in the kitchen, I assume. The duty manager dealt with this in an efficient and professional way. The level of customer care from her was outstanding (unsure of her name but she had perfect winged eyeliner!) She wouldn't even let us pay the service charge in the end although we did leave a tip. Although it was a small blip it was an important one which she recognised. The only other negative was my husband wasn't asked if he wanted any more tea, whereas I was brought hot water for a top up automatically. None of this would stop us recommending it. The tea room staff were very, very good. Shame the same can't be said of some of the ground floor till staff!"

London,tea,Bond St. Tea Rooms,ChIJHafnNNMadkgRwUwBgJyH0YA,"350 Oxford St, London",4.4,L U,"Not an authentic afternoon tea experience. If you are visiting England/ UK, and looking to try out afternoon tea, please please avoid this place. This is not correct afternoon tea. Its not necessarily terrible. It‚Äôs just not afternoon tea.

-You only get to pick 2x savoury items and 2x items from the sweet section. That‚Äôs all. In a correct afternoon tea experience, if there are 4x kinds of sandwiches on the menu, you will be served all 4 of them. Also, there are definitely more than 2x savoury items in any other afternoon tea places.

-They don‚Äôt give you any seconds/ refills. A standard for any afternoon tea is they come back and offer more sandwiches and cakes.

-Instead of normal sandwiches, their savoury section consists mostly of general starter foods (fried courgettes, bruschetta, Caesar salad etc)

-They had no plain scone. They had scones with sultana and scones with chestnut, and scones with orange. Plain scone was not even on the menu. And again, you had to select two kinds of scones from the menu.

-One actual ‚Äòsandwich‚Äô I had, cucumber with cream cheese, was very dry. The bread was dry.

The variety of food you get to choose was disappointing. 2x items from savoury and sweet means that you only get to taste one kind of cake apart from a (let‚Äôs face it) mandatory scone. The overall quantity of food was disappointing. The quality of the food was also disappointing. The one real ‚Äòsandwich‚Äô I had was very dry as I mentioned above. The other starter I had, fried courgettes was fine.

I had some sense of closure when, upon leaving the hotel, I saw an Italian restaurant on the ground floor. I looked at their menu and found a good number of the same items offered in the ‚Äòafternoon tea‚Äô dining area upstairs. They essentially serve the same food from the same kitchen and package them differently upstairs. Operationally, it makes sense. It makes an efficient production line. But to call this ‚Äòafternoon tea‚Äô is a massive stretch. Essentially, this ‚Äòafternoon tea‚Äô area is an afterthought to the existing Italian restaurant downstairs."

London,tea,East & Tea.Co - Bubble Tea Hounslow,ChIJj3sztt4NdkgRuECGziHExzA,"281, Marketplace, 287 High St, Hounslow",3.9,Devi S,"Edit - I've come back a few times a year or so later and my god this place has gone downhill. The drinks don't taste nice at all, overly sweet, tapioca is all chewy and hard clumped together, it's just not nice at all. No real good flavour jaut taste watered down.

Also do not get TOO GOOD TO Go all you get is 2 small drinks one milk one fruit. The flavours are horrible and soo sweet.

My friends and I absolutely love bubble tea but this place aint it. If you're looking for a good tasty bubble tea, rich in flavour then I would only recommend this place for FRUIT TEAS. I would NOT recommend this place for any speciality or milk teas.

My friends would often get the fruit teas here and recommended it for me when I come to visit. The fruit teas are nice, they're tasty and pretty decent for the price of around ¬£4-¬£5. And they offer Loyalty cards if you frequently buy. Fruit teas  8/10.

Now the milk teas is where they are really let down by. The Taro is very weak in taste Bright purple colour but not very tasty, seems as though its very watered down and you only get a tiny taro taste, otherwise would have thought I was just drinking milk. Alot of the milk teas including the brown sugar also taste watered down and weak. 6.5/10

So the fruit teas are great but the milk are meh, so I decided to try Matcha since I love Matcha tasting foods anyways. This was vile. Couldn't even finish my drink, took a sip and it tasted soo bitter, artificial and powdery, yes powdery in a liquid drink!!! 1/10 only because of the boba, they were nice. I don't know who made it but they certainly didn't mix it right.

So Fruit Teas great, Milk Teas meh, Matcha is a definitely no, what about the tapioca pearls, jellies and fruit pearly. Well all these are great! The tapioca pearls were soft and squishy and a slight sweetness in taste. The fruit jellies and fruit pearls were also very nice. I have seen some people say that the sugar syrup that the tapioca pearls are soaked in are watered down but I guess this depends on the person making your drink.

The customer service though is amazing!! Friendly staff every time i've been. Shame the drinks don't match. We have stopped coming here unless its for the fruit teas, we don't order or recommend any of the milk or speciality teas anymore, too disappointed, never had a good milk tea here.

Overall I give 3 stars.
One for the customer service and friendly staff, one for their fruit teas being good, 1/2 for their jellies and pearls being tasty and 1/2 for using plant based straws. There are better bubble tea stores at just a few pence more but soo much better so that is why I only give three stars."

Even the there were only two girls in there preparing in store and online delivery orders, the girl on the tills was very helpful and explained what the Tao Tao drink was, she lets customers smell the tea to give them a sense of what it will taste like and advised me on the sweetness level for my drink. I ended up getting the Tao Tao with cheese cap and 70% sugar. I thought the sugar would be too much but it wasn‚Äôt. They‚Äôve got a good feel of what level is appropriate for which drink and maybe the 70% was because I‚Äôm not Asian and she assumed I‚Äôd like it sweeter.

The tapioca bubbles were so chewy but in a delicious and naturally tasty way. They say that they have designated employees ‚Äúcooking‚Äù tapioca every day.

Not only beverages, they also have buns and pastries. I was actually there for their taro bun, but it was sold out, and apparently only available during the weekend.

However, I was lucky enough to catch a new patch of freshly fried Chinese dough twist! It‚Äôs called Mahua, and they had several flavours available. I had the purple sweet potato one and it was superb. Not too sweet, very filling and satisfying, and the texture was a pure delight.

The only downside is that their price is on the relatively high end. At most bubble tea shops, one extra portion of tapioca always ends with cents, but this one charges more than ¬£1. The Mahua also costs ¬£7."

I also enjoyed their custard pudding bun, which was fresh and delightful.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, even with the language barrier. They were patient with my questions and explained the menu clearly.

Lovely bubble tea, attentive staff, and beautiful cakes! I thoroughly enjoy all their cakes (matcha mille crepe, Japanese cheesecake, and strawberry roll cake), however, the strawberry roll cake is a special favourite.

And so, I ordered a whole roll by contacting East & Tea.Co directly (12 slices, a few are missing in the photos because we weren't patient enough)...it was so delicious, I just had to share.

Beautifully fluffy strawberry sponges, carefully filled with two types of a delicate cream cheese (I think? One lightly flavoured with strawberry, the other just cream cheese/cream), fresh strawberries tucked within, and lovingly topped with a ribbon of cream (?) and fresh raspberries (which we didn't expect!!)! Just looking at the photos makes me hungry again! (Apologies if the second photo is lower in quality, I have removed my messy kitchen from sight)

This went beyond our expectations as the individual strawberry rolls in-store differ slightly from the ordered whole roll (e.g the in-store rolls have a delightful strawberry jelly (?) inside instead of a strawberry). East & Tea.Co were so lovely throughout the ordering process. The customer service is A+++ - for example, the raspberries were a special surprise!

Utterly delicious! I can't wait for another special day to come by again so I can order another whole roll!"

Plenty of outdoor seating both in front and at the back. Need a little more attention to what goes inside what they serve: example, avocado in my bagel wasn‚Äôt 100%. Otherwise, portions are generous and the food is fresh. Staff is attentive and welcoming. Coffee is good. Ice cream is excellent. Selection of off-the-shelf snacks is fun. Sweet treats are great variety and we always buy too many, because they look so good! Shame they shut their toilets to discourage all the walkers by from using them but hope they can come up with a better solution than that. The park toilets next door are as expected in London: well below standards. Overall we are loving this place and highly recommend it."

‚ô° Pros:
‚Ä¢ Staff was very friendly and accommodating

√ó Cons
¬∞ No cream cheese top whatsoever on the drink despite paying for it
¬∞ Bubbles were quite hard and not sweet/flavoured at all
¬∞ Asked for less ice and less sugar, my bubble tea just tasted like almond milk with no additional flavouring.
¬∞ Some broken oreo inside the cup to indicate it was oreo.

The drink was on the cool (not cold) side of lukewarm even with ice cubes in it, the taro milk tea was decent but for ¬£5.95 I would expect something nicer as this shop‚Äôs competitors do the same large drink for the same price or less and tastes much better, I think the best way to describe the drink was it tasting a little flat, it didn‚Äôt have that zing that some bubble tea drinks I‚Äôve tried have had. However the shop was clean and looked nice enough, and the staff were fine. Would I come here again? Maybe, if all the other shops were extremely busy or closed then I most likely would."

Friendly service and lots of families coming to enjoy a bubble tea. Very clean with nice seating inside.

I got the cheesy strawberry bubble tea and it was really good. I think they use a significant amount of either artificial sweetener or a lot of sugar in their syrup which was a bit off.  It the cream cheese on top was very nice and not too salty.

Will be there for more to investigate!"

It had nothing to do with wintermelon, tasted like nothing, was watery and bland. Boba was fine but if I hadn't asked for it I would probably just get the tea on it's own. Staff should take more initiative. First two straws I grabbed were kinda soft/damaged and didn't pierce the lid properly causing a spillage. Staff did nothing to help. Also why is there no place to sit inside? A few bar stools wouldn't hurt. Overall, it wasn't a very good experience, not for the price.

The room is lovely and I like the flower motif chandeliers. The chairs were comfortable and they did a nice job accommodating my gluten allergy (celiac) . I got an equal amount of food as my non-gf spouse.
My favorite teas were the vanilla rooibos and the mango. My husband‚Äôs favorite were the Bora Bora (very fruity) and the Chai.
The bathroom downstairs was very clean and well-appointed with lotion, hand towels as well as dryers.
The improvement area could be that we had to wait awhile to order and several of the sweet items my husband received on his regular platter should be naturally gluten free, such as French macarons, so it‚Äôs kinda weird they don‚Äôt just bake all of those in the gf kitchen and then bring those needed in the regular kitchen when necessary.
We also didn‚Äôt care for a couple of the sandwiches- my husband doesn‚Äôt care for cheese and there was a cheese sandwich and although I normally like ham and roast beef, I didn‚Äôt enjoy either of those sandwiches, and the gf carrot cake was dry and terrible. They should try the gf recipethat‚Äôs made with pineapple for added moisture."

Staff was friendly and welcoming. But as they got busier, checking out wasn't the same. Not rude but not polite either. More like ""we are done, you can leave"".

Avocado brunch was the most bland I've ever had.
The sausages in the full breakfast was more than charred in places. Had to leave it.
Eggs, we asked scrambled. Tasted more like the mixed readymade scramble eggs at hotels like Holiday Inn. Not fresh. Apparently they could only make sunny side up or scrambled. Not regular omelette. Not sure if the sunny side up are also not fresh ü§¢

The Rose lemonade was just rose water with barely any fizz. Absolutely not worth getting. The chai latte without coffee was good. Again, tea pot wasn't. Don't need to pay so much for horribly tasting tea bags dunked in water."

The line of people waiting to get a table is strong testament to the decades of quality of service at this place.

There are nothing fancy or instagrammable here if that is what you want when you eat a breakfast or brunch. There are only well made British breakfasts, sandwiches and tea cakes. Whether you need a full English or a single cream tea, this place will guarantee a fulfilling meal for anyone, even someone like me who don't care for breakfast at all.

My only issue was that the the staff messed up the coffee order we placed and brought a normal coffee when my wife had asked for decaf cappuccino and that woukd have caused issues for her had he unknowingly drank it. The staff apologised quickly for that oversight and replaced drink. Also the muffin  I had ordered was toasted a bit too much making it hard to cut into with a fork.

Nonetheless we had a happy experience and I will definitely have this place in my list of places that I will visit again and again."

Positives: lovely scones and tea and setting inside. Sandwiches are just ok - bread is soft and fresh but see below

Negatives:
any of the other food that comes in the afternoon tea - the cakes are cheap, cream cakes that taste of nothing.
Sandwiches - just ok, but a little tasteless

By far though and the reason why I will not visit again is the waiting staff (everyone I encountered from asking for a table, for a menu when seated and then the bill) are extremely rude and dismissive. Like a previous reviewer, they made me feel like we were an inconvenience by being a customer. You can tell they are talking about customers (in a non complimentary way) in front of them in another language and it‚Äôs just unacceptable."

The food are neatly arranged by hand so they actually look that good when served

I have ordered chicken and dried shrimp sauce with crispy fried chicken (sounds Taiwan)

The fried chicken are great, much like the Taiwanese style fried chicken. I like it very much

Chicken and dried shrimp sauce is Great. It carries the Taiwan raised pork rice vibe

Feels happy to be able to get two of the top dishes from Taiwan in one set lunch

Rice are Jasmine rice, not the authentic pearl rice
They still cook them in the way that rice sticks together and able to be pucked up by chopsticks. Just like the pearl rice does!

This was the worst bubble tea I‚Äôve ever tasted in my life. This is not an exaggeration.

I can usually drink almost anything even if it isn‚Äôt to my tastes. After waiting and receiving bad service from the cashier, i received my drink with the wrong order and had to correct it. The cashier said it would be a waste of new bottles but I politely insisted.

After leaving the store and tasting the drink I spat it out - this was after ordering at least 7 bubble teas for my whole family. I am convinced that the milk they‚Äôre using is expired. The boba tasted dry and flaky and the side toppings were disgusting.

I‚Äôm truly shocked that this is a business that is allowed to serve these drinks.  This was the worst experience I‚Äôve genuinely ever had and i feel sick."

The atmosphere was cozy, and even the restroom was pristine. With so much to explore in London, we‚Äôll definitely return on our next visit. Booking a month in advance was necessary and entirely worth it.

Compared to other stores, Teddy Bear Bubble Tea Hammersmith offers a wide variety of teas and even other extra options for example frapp√© teas which by the way, are incredible.

Their prices are very similar to other stores but for what they offer, you would say it is extremely cheap.

Another great thing is thr fact that they have so many choices that you van always try a different bubble tea if you actually wanted to and combinations are endless as you can change toppings of most teas.

The milk and juices they use are light to be digested which is even better."

The first thing I noticed was the charming interior design and cozy atmosphere of the shop, which made me feel instantly welcomed.

As for the menu, it was extensive and offered a variety of drinks, including milk tea, fruit tea, and even some unique options like taro latte and matcha smoothie. I ordered a classic milk tea with tapioca pearls, and it was one of the best I've ever had. The tea was perfectly brewed and had just the right amount of sweetness, while the tapioca pearls were cooked to perfection and had a nice chewy texture.

One thing I appreciated about Tea Time was the option to customize the sweetness and ice level of your drink, which allowed me to tailor my drink to my liking. Additionally, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and they were happy to answer any questions I had about the menu.

The only downside was the long wait time during peak hours, but it was worth it for the high-quality drinks and service.

I organise socials after my dance classes and I used to come every Saturday with a group of girls (4-6 of us). Last time I asked the barista to turn down the music a little bit and she refused. We were the only visitors there at that time. The barista said something about the cafe policy and that in other cafes the music is even louder. I didn‚Äôt get it at all. Unfortunately I have to choose another much quieter cafe to go with my group. It‚Äôs impossible to speak without shouting there. Quite annoying."

Vibes were chill and cosy, the cafe was decorated with Halloween themed props which was nice and festive.

Ordered an americano and a hazelnut croissant coming to a total of ¬£6.70, fairly affordable in the Victoria area. Americano was large for a regular size, hence good value for money. It's smooth and strong, no sour after taste which was exactly how I like my coffee. Croissant was alright, it had the subtle hint of lemon/ citrusy taste in the pastry which I don't usually like but the hazelnut/ Nutella filling made up with the nutty sweetness. Could have done with much more filling but it was a nice pastry overall.

Would be happy to come back regularly for their coffee and I want to try other pastries next time."

Not very busy when we went. They have a nice selection of sweet and savoury food. Everything looks good, tastes good, coffee is a nice blend .
The salt beef bagel is a bit dry, could use something more than mustard.

The one thing that does stand out is the music. Totally inappropriate for this type is establishment. Doesn't go at all and kind of ruins a nice atmosphere.
Seriously, it needs changing. I don't want to enjoy a nice pastry and coffee with friends and have someone's in the background saying they want to bang a woman one more time on pop-tehno beats.

If you can stand the negatives, I'd recommend this cafe."

In the store, you can see the coffee beans roast and store up in tubes, as you order any coffee-based drink.

The location is a short walking distance from London bridge station (the exit that leads to the bus station), so I was able to pick something up and catch the train with ease.

Looking for a small, yet cosy place to work on those deadlines? This is a good place!

The barrister told me that they use ceremonial grade matcha which is what I was looking for and I ordered the iced matcha with oat milk & blueberry syrup (over ¬£5). It was one of the best matcha's I've had so far! It wasn't too sweet, not bland but just right & I was thinking of buying a second one after the first sip!

I was very surprised by the design, as well as how this coffee establishment looks in everything, firstly, a very expensive design.  I would even say very nice, since there is coffee everywhere, a very pleasant smell of fresh fruit coffee, they bake themselves and sell them as well.  You can order some food right there they can make, I mean cook for you.  They have a very tasty omelette.  They have delicious sandwiches too.  You can order natural juice and taste what they do locally.  These, but in any case, I really liked the pleasant staff.But I will definitely go there.  Maybe not even one, so I recommend.

Atmosphere:  Small and vibrant.  Local shop vibes with inoffensive generic guitar music in the background.  I was there at around 8am and it was busy with what appeared to be loyal locals of the 2 legged and the 4 legged variety.  They even had a water bowl for dogs in their little outside seating space."

While the staff was friendly and welcoming, the overall experience fell short of expectations. The coffee itself had bright, juicy notes, but there was no variety of beans to choose from, or at least I was not informed of any options.

The space was very small with limited seating, and when I took out a tablet to read, I was informed that laptops and tablets are not allowed during weekends. While I understand the need for such policies, they should be clearly communicated to customers before they sit down or make a purchase. Given the size and atmosphere of the cafe, it didn‚Äôt feel particularly work-friendly to begin with, so the policy was surprising.

Overall, Nostos feels more suited as a take-away shop, where more space could be dedicated to the baristas, and a stronger focus could be placed on the variety of coffee beans. As it stands, the cafe lacks the space and ambiance to serve as a cosy place to stay in for a coffee."

The coffee comes from the specialty roasters at Assembly coffee. The espresso and cortado were perfectly brewed and went well with the fresh pain au chocolate.

I ordered only a flat white (both time I have been) and the drink was perfect.  Excellent espresso and the foam was some of the best I have ever had.  I will return many times just because of this.

The location is quite cool, under the street in Fitzrovia.  It is an old urinal.   There are enough seats for only about 10-12 people so be wary at busy times that you may need to wait if you want to stay in.

They are dog friendly, but there is not a lot of space for dogs to lay on the floor.

They don‚Äôt mind you working on your computer there and they have WiFi.  However, due to the limited space I would suggest being considerate and not planning to be there all afternoon."

The Attendant is very smart for choosing this location.

The seating is very limited so I recommend going there before noon to avoid the crowd, and to have the place almost entirely yours to take as many photos you want.

It‚Äôs table service, and you pay when you finish. So don‚Äôt just simply walk out!

I am initially attracted by the good reviews especially for their matcha latte. I bought it as a drink to carry along my journey in the tube.

As soon as the drink was served, I stir the drink and left for the tube.

Upon entering the tube, I took a sip of the drink and felt instant regret not asking them to add another shot of matcha because the drink tasted only of oat milk.

Regardless of my regret, I think they could've done better in the first place to ensure that the matcha latte is a legit one.

This review is solely for their matcha latte drink and i haven't yet tried their coffee. Other than the drink, i have no complaints."

I asked the barista which coffee (filter or latte) he would recommend, and after explaining what kind of coffee they were. He offered to let me try some of the filter and while I got the latte.
Both were very delicious and unique in their own way. The latte was smooth and naturally sweet. The filter had a unique strong flavor. I enjoyed both very much.
I also had a cinnamon bun with the coffee, which was nice but not flaky enough for my taste.

They also serve a very good full English breakfast and some variations they you can build up as you please. The avocado on toast is also really good, the wu  as lot of everything they cook is just beyond your average breakfast spot. Special mention also to the sausage rolls, if they are not sold out you must get whatever they have on display they are a cut above any other sausage roll you tasted before. Lastly, even the choice of waters is good with San Pellegrino and Evian, 2 of my all time favourites. During the weekend there is always a queue, so I suggest either to go early or late or to ho midweek when it is still busy but there are no long queues."

I feel compelled to address the recent reviews concerning this exceptional cafe and its staff, which I find unfair. As a loyal patron since their opening, I can attest that these reviews do not accurately reflect the true nature of this establishment.

This locally run coffee shop has been a valued cornerstone of our community, consistently delivering outstanding service and high-quality offerings. The welcoming and warm atmosphere is a direct result of the dedication and hard work of the staff.

Regarding the waiter in question, my experiences have always been exemplary. The waiter, along with the entire team, exhibits professionalism, courtesy, and a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction. These qualities are what keep me and many others coming back.

Had I not been on a facetime to my son, I would have intervened to support the staff and the establishment.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly support this cafe and its team. Their consistent excellence and dedication to their patrons deserve recognition and appreciation, not baseless criticism."

I could excuse slow service at that time since they were very busy, but the second time I came was a different story. I came on a Thursday afternoon - not particularly busy. My order was taken, but I had to wait 20 minutes to receive my coffee (a simple flat white). I at first didn't think much of it, but then I noticed that people who had arrived after me had already received their drinks. It turns out they had totally forgotten about my order! No apology, no explanation, just a ""You wanted a flat white, right?"" and then it turned up 3 minutes later.
Ultimately, the coffee is okay, especially for the price, and the atmosphere is pretty nice for socialising (on quieter days)... you just have to expect slow service."

The chai coffee latte was delicious. Cake standard.
Interior is ok.
They add service charge on top of a bill but this was deserved although I had only coffee with cake, no food."

Despite the name, it is a beautiful pub that has got it all sorted.

Real Ales, cold lagers, good wine selection and a garden to sit in to enjoy it.

Added bonus is the Gluten-free Fish and Chips.

In the evening, past 5pm, the very ""cool-vibe"" cocktail bar opens its doors downstairs. So you have a choice of a traditional pub OR a funky cocktail bar.

A great find that just may become our ""local"" whenever we are staying in the King's Cross area."

The atmosphere is lovely, it was chilled and there are some great sociable seating areas. It did start to get busy as I left, and started to get pretty loud. But it's inevitable when there is no sound deadening and it's 1.5 height room with exposed metal, brick and full height glass windows."

The caf√© not only offers a welcoming and warm atmosphere but also delivers a level of service that truly stands out.
A special mention must go to Naomi, who completely boosted my passion for coffee. She took the time to explain the entire process of how their coffee beans are roasted and how each of our favorite coffee drinks is carefully made right in front of us. Her enthusiasm and knowledge made me appreciate coffee in a whole new way. Naomi‚Äôs kindness and patience were remarkable.
she guided me through the different options and helped me choose the perfect beans for my filter coffee.
The filter coffee itself was excellent, bursting with rich, complex flavors. What makes this caf√© unique and attractive is the opportunity to choose your preferred type of coffee beans, ensuring every cup is tailored to your taste.I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to Naomi for her outstanding service and passion, which made my visit not just enjoyable but unforgettable.

I visited at 11am on a Thursday, and the place was quite busy. The caf√© has only eight small tables inside, each accommodating two people, with some additional seating available outside on the pavement.

I opted for a Batch Brew priced at ¬£3.50, which was well-balanced, avoiding the overly citrusy and floral notes that I often find in similar brews. While the staff mentioned that using a laptop is fine, there‚Äôs no Wi-Fi available, and I noticed that I was the only person working on one, which suggests it's not the typical vibe. Plus, the mobile reception inside is poor, making it hard to use a personal hotspot.

Notably, there are no customer toilets, and by midday, the caf√© becomes much quieter. As for the staff, they seemed a bit cold at first, especially during busy times, but they warmed up considerably with regulars. Overall, it's a decent spot for a quick coffee, but perhaps not the best choice if you‚Äôre planning to work remotely."

The beans they use are clearly high quality, and the baristas know how to extract the best from them.

Inviting atmosphere:
The cafe has a relaxed and welcoming vibe. The space is clean and modern, with comfortable seating and plenty of natural light. It's a great place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee.

Now, I work at a specialty coffee shop so let me tell you what disappointed me. The first strike was the cold brew; besides the fact none of the baristas knew what bean it was made of they also shrugged me off like I was bothering them when I asked. When I tried the cold brew though, the disappointment was the worst. Never have I ever thrown out a full cup of coffee to trash right away but I also trained my palate and this cold brew was just so so so old and it tasted like the ratio between coffee and water was off.  It was just really not good coffee and it was sad for a coffee shop advertising they sell and brew specialty coffee. The baristas had absolutely no idea about any of the beans on sale or on daily filters. The atmosphere inside was nice and the pastries looked literally better than the coffee. Get the croissants, I‚Äôm sad I didn‚Äôt. So for anyone who is not picky about their coffee, this might be the place to go. For someone who makes an experience of it, not so much. I would only say maybe train your baristas better? The time spent at your place could have been way more pleasant weren‚Äôt it for the two girls who had no idea what they were doing :/"

It's recommended for cafe lovers

Besides cafe, that have a few pantries (croissants etc.), most of which are made of plant based sources. See images.

While I understand (from other reviews) that they use speciality cafe beans, I'm not that of a connoisseur to know the difference. It's clear though that they know what they are doing!

I had a rough experience at Notes in the past (slow service, inattentive staff), but I recently decided to give them another shot.  I'm happy to report a significant improvement!  A friendly manager (possibly Italian?) helped out a new waitress and provided excellent service.  He even apologized for the wait and offered a menu, a stark contrast to my previous experience.

I visited twice for wine and snacks, and both times the manager impressed me with his extensive wine knowledge.  He expertly guided customers towards the perfect selections.  The white wines were fantastic!

However, the coffee wasn't quite there.  For the price (especially considering the service charge), the quality wasn't up to par.  WatchHouse nearby offers a better cup for a better price.  On the other hand, the service during my coffee visit was phenomenal (thanks Paige!).

The Spinach & Feta Parcels were a delightful surprise!  Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside ‚Äì just perfect.  The flavor profile was excellent, with a great balance of textures and tastes.  These would pair wonderfully with a glass of white wine, and I highly recommend trying them.

Overall, Notes seems to be under new management, and the service has drastically improved.  While the coffee needs some work, everything else was fantastic.  I'll definitely be back for the Spinach & Feta Parcels and the great wine selection, but I might wait to see if the coffee improves before ordering it again."

London,bubble tea,Double Bubble,ChIJnUqm_KKh2EcRdHkDpHZoeKU,"38 Kings Rd, London",4.3,Riz,"Ordered a family deal of 4 drinks for ¬£25 (with delivery) from the Deliveroo app. Bearing in mind this was the 3 third time I had done so from the app. The app showed that all drinks would be made the same as the other 3 as per the deal conditions. On delivery one drink was as ordered with the jelly bits and bubbles. The other three were a plain brown tea. I refused the order and sent the driver away with them. On phoning the store to clarify the issue I was told I would have to pay extra for the bubbles to be added. I said I would head over to clarify. I was told the delivery rider hadn't returned to the store with the drinks and that I was apparently meant to have brought them back. I was further informed that I needed to order another set of drinks as I didn't have them. The rider never returned to the store and even though I showed the staff in the store that I had the video on my ring doorbell of me giving the guy the drinks back, they said they wouldn't make me more drinks. My only option was to buy more. That would have been ¬£50 for 4 teas in all. I couldn't stomach that. ¬£25 with delivery for flavoured water I could just about deal with, as it makes my kids happy. But to be inconvenienced and made to feel like I was trying to pull a scam was not pleasant. After half an hour of trying to negotiate between the store staff and deliveroo I did eventually get a couple of partial refunds totalling the order value. But I did feel very let down by the whole experience. Unhappy kids and unhappy an dad. Not anywhere near good customer service."

Great addition to Chingford."
London,bubble tea,Double Bubble,ChIJnUqm_KKh2EcRdHkDpHZoeKU,"38 Kings Rd, London",4.3,Honor Mitchell,"I had a vanilla milk tea with tapioca bubbles - service and atmosphere is great, but I do feel as if maybe the drinks are a bit too sweet? Of course, it probably depends what flavour you get and a lot of people probably enjoy the sugar, but I just think that maybe adding a few less pumps of syrup/vanilla would make it more palatable.

I would also definitely recommend investing in some additional smaller cup sizes as some people (including me) may want smaller portions and can‚Äôt drink the whole of the current cup size.

Finally, having the calories on the menu would be really helpful - this would be beneficial for not only people on diets but also people like me who have had eating disorders in the past and require the calories to feel as comfortable as possible.

However, other than that, I think that my drink was really tasty, just a bit sickly, but everyone‚Äôs different and you can get different flavours, right? An amazing shop and I would definitely tell my friends to go there, these are just my recommendations to possibly make it more inclusive. Thank you!"

London,bubble tea,Double Bubble,ChIJnUqm_KKh2EcRdHkDpHZoeKU,"38 Kings Rd, London",4.3,J S,"(Going to make short points as i have alot to go over. )

Noticed this new store a few months ago.
Regularly drink bubble tea from a wide range of stores around London; ranging from English ‚Äòversions‚Äô of the original drink to long-brew Thai & Chinese teas.

First impressions.
- Very bright, open clean  & clear store, similar to a desert bar.
- Clear, easy read menu behind bar
- Plastic free straws ( honestly didn‚Äôt expect this but i value the choice alot)

During my service i asked about dairy free milk options‚Ä¶ i had to ask FOUR times as the colleague didn‚Äôt understand what ‚Äòdairy free products were‚Äô‚Ä¶. Which concerns me in terms of allergens & customer safety.

Inplace of a milk tea i ordered a ‚Äòmango‚Äô bubble tea with tapioca no ice.

Drink was made quickly with no issue, as i left the store I noticed I wasn‚Äôt given a recipt or Tapioca.

I returned and another colleague came over, I explained the issue and she had fixed the issue  with no problem whatsoever, by just adding it afterwards, its a good thing I hadn‚Äôt gone home without it. thank you for sorting the problem genuinely.

‚Äî‚Äî-

Negatives:
- no dairy free options of any kind for people with milk allergies

- Cups only come in 1 size priced at ¬£4.99‚Ä¶ alot more expensive than other brands such as bubbleology. I wouldn‚Äôt of minded the price if you had dairy free options & well brewed tea. Ive happily paid for ¬£8 drinks because they make the drinks from scratch and the price equates the quality.

-  Tried there mango bubble tea, no taste of tea; bagged or loose leaf. whatsoever. flavour is closer to a cheap cordial mix doused in sugar. ( ironic to be making ‚Äòbubbletea‚Äô drinks that neither contain tea Or decent tapioca.

- I read other reviews and I understand your a ‚Äòdesert focused brand‚Äô such as your shakes and cakes. However if i dont enjoy a product that covered just under half your menu you‚Äôve already lost custom from me and others who enjoy quality beverages.

- tapioca were small and dense compared to other brands and homemade ones.

- Ironically although straws are biodegradable‚Ä¶ cups are general plastic. ( most bubble tea places are plastic but it‚Äôd be good to see them go completely plastic free & stand out in the market from other brands.)

- no local competition so likely explains pricing; which would be completely fine -if- the quality was there.

Unfortunately I dont recommend this desert place. The prices are far too high. ( ¬£4.99 for 1 size bubble tea & ¬£3.99 for ‚Äòschool dinner cakes. If i wanted a ‚Äòschool dinner cake‚Äô I‚Äôd be expecting ‚Äòschool dinner‚Äô prices.

The customer service itself was fine, I assume the first person who served me didn‚Äôt know about allergens & forgot the tapioca?? But was genuinely polite overall.

The second lady who served me, I‚Äôm very grateful for you fixing the problem with no hesitation and i cant fault your services.

If i could ask for a refund I would have liked to, however there wasn‚Äôt an option for a receipt.
Overall unfortunately I don‚Äôt recommend this store."

Whilst the service was warm and friendly, this is the average bubble tea spot whereby their milk tea drinks are made from artificially flavoured powders which was what my green melon milk tea had. Their pearls didn‚Äôt seem to disappoint as they were soft and bouncy, but some were firm in the middle. Not the best. Prices don‚Äôt reflect the quality as mine came to ¬£5.05, just slightly below what you‚Äôd get from a shop that delivers fresh ingredients.

London,bubble tea,Beyond Boba Bubble Tea - Whitechapel,ChIJR6zs9J0DdkgR5Jgs-biin9M,"349 Commercial Rd, London",4,Sima Miah,"I went to Beyond Boba at around 10:30pm on 24/07/24 and I was already disappointed when I walked in as the only employee working at the time seemed to be too busy talking to her friend who had popped in to visit her than to greet the only paying customer in the shop. This was also quite unhygienic and a health and safety hazard as the friend was in the back of the shop. I thought this was slightly strange but disregarded it as they were two young girls and the shop was empty but this did already leave a slightly bad taste in my mouth of unprofessionalism. After about 5 minutes she finally asked me what I wanted when i then asked for 4 regular drinks. To which she then replied, they don‚Äôt have regular cups only large ones. This isnt something completely alien as I have been to other boba shops where this is not the customers fault but more an inconvenience on the business‚Äô part, therefore they would either offer a complimentary upgrade or put the regular quantity in a large cup. As a boba shop how can you run out of cups? I also think it was very inconsiderate that she wasted my time not asking me for my order for a good 5 minutes, for me to only hear they dont even have regular drinks at the moment. Surely for efficiency there would be a sign? Or the employee gives a disclaimer when you walk in the shop? The only reason i didnt then opt for 4 large drinks is because these were for children and they wouldn‚Äôt have finished it, which wouldve been a vast waste of money. When I then asked if there was a way to get a regular size in the large cup, she rudely shook her head and giggled with her friend beside her and said ‚Äúno‚Äù. This was highly unprofessional and to not offer an alternative is absolutely ridiculous. This was really poor customer service and I am really upset by it. If she politely said there was no regulars or said no, then fair enough but the rude tone was an absolute no for me! I hope this business invests some time into retraining their colleagues with kind and welcoming customer service, because if they keep going like this, they will be going out of commission! I would avoid coming here!"

The Crown Royal Tea is missing the milk foam  top and Mango Fanatics is missing the coconut and condensed milk!

I went to collect my drink but they didn‚Äôt make them yet as they were still doing someone else‚Äôs order which is fine so I sat and waited.
When he gave me the drinks I said ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not what I ordered. That‚Äôs a regular Royal Tea and that‚Äôs a large Mango Green Tea but I ordered the Crown Royal Tea and Mango Fanatics‚Äô.

I‚Äôve had both drinks before so I know what they look like but the man seemed to have no clue what I was talking about and just kept telling me they are the right drinks.  I‚Äôve never seen him before as I often go to T4 Brixton so clear he doesn‚Äôt work there often.
I even showed him the picture on the menu of what it‚Äôs suppose to be and he just told me ‚Äòoh the picture is different‚Äô so I asked him to call the other lady, this lady knew what I meant and she told me ‚Äòyeah we don‚Äôt have anymore‚Äô and I‚Äôm not lying when I say she literally just walked off into the other room after saying that.

I ended up taking the drinks since neither of them offered a partial refund and I didn‚Äôt want these to go to waste but I think what annoyed me more is they they didn‚Äôt bother telling me they didn‚Äôt have all the ingredients when they knew I was waiting.

They just decided to make the drinks without them. If they had told me, I would have just asked for different drinks to be made instead.

Personally not very impressed with this bubble tea place compared to all the others that I have visited in London so wouldn't really recommend it. However 2 stars rather than 1 because staff were friendly"
London,bubble tea,East & Tea.Co - Bubble Tea Hounslow,ChIJj3sztt4NdkgRuECGziHExzA,"281, Marketplace, 287 High St, Hounslow",3.9,Devi S,"Edit - I've come back a few times a year or so later and my god this place has gone downhill. The drinks don't taste nice at all, overly sweet, tapioca is all chewy and hard clumped together, it's just not nice at all. No real good flavour jaut taste watered down.

Also do not get TOO GOOD TO Go all you get is 2 small drinks one milk one fruit. The flavours are horrible and soo sweet.

My friends and I absolutely love bubble tea but this place aint it. If you're looking for a good tasty bubble tea, rich in flavour then I would only recommend this place for FRUIT TEAS. I would NOT recommend this place for any speciality or milk teas.

My friends would often get the fruit teas here and recommended it for me when I come to visit. The fruit teas are nice, they're tasty and pretty decent for the price of around ¬£4-¬£5. And they offer Loyalty cards if you frequently buy. Fruit teas  8/10.

Now the milk teas is where they are really let down by. The Taro is very weak in taste Bright purple colour but not very tasty, seems as though its very watered down and you only get a tiny taro taste, otherwise would have thought I was just drinking milk. Alot of the milk teas including the brown sugar also taste watered down and weak. 6.5/10

So the fruit teas are great but the milk are meh, so I decided to try Matcha since I love Matcha tasting foods anyways. This was vile. Couldn't even finish my drink, took a sip and it tasted soo bitter, artificial and powdery, yes powdery in a liquid drink!!! 1/10 only because of the boba, they were nice. I don't know who made it but they certainly didn't mix it right.

So Fruit Teas great, Milk Teas meh, Matcha is a definitely no, what about the tapioca pearls, jellies and fruit pearly. Well all these are great! The tapioca pearls were soft and squishy and a slight sweetness in taste. The fruit jellies and fruit pearls were also very nice. I have seen some people say that the sugar syrup that the tapioca pearls are soaked in are watered down but I guess this depends on the person making your drink.

The customer service though is amazing!! Friendly staff every time i've been. Shame the drinks don't match. We have stopped coming here unless its for the fruit teas, we don't order or recommend any of the milk or speciality teas anymore, too disappointed, never had a good milk tea here.

Overall I give 3 stars.
One for the customer service and friendly staff, one for their fruit teas being good, 1/2 for their jellies and pearls being tasty and 1/2 for using plant based straws. There are better bubble tea stores at just a few pence more but soo much better so that is why I only give three stars."

Hefaure Uxbridge offers a delightful culinary experience with a pleasant ambiance and attentive service. During our visit, we encountered a minor hiccup when served an earlier made cold scoffle pancake. However, upon bringing it to their attention, they promptly remade it to our satisfaction. While their service was commendable, it would enhance customer experience if they specified whether pancakes should be served hot or cold. Overall, Hefaure Uxbridge delivers a satisfying dining experience with room for improvement in communication regarding food temperature preferences."

I had the mashed avocado with mushroom on sourdough bread unfortunately the only 4eggs they had available was hard boiled (I wanted scrambled eggs) it was lovely, nice and simple.

My friend had the mushroom and Feta Cheese on sourdough bread. We both then ordered the strawberry and cream crepes, delicious.

the volcanic chicken meal and it came out like this!! looks nothing like the menu pictures, like an inflated ball. i ate into half the chicken before realising the inside was RAW, the staff showed no care just offered something else on the menu, but as i lost all trust i just wanted my money back to which they said ‚Äòno‚Äô.

The seasoning choice is overwhelming and you can combine your favourites. I like Kimchi, seaweed and plum. Numbing spicy seasoning also very good but not that numbing.

Portions pretty big so worth the money, though much more expensive than places like KFC.

Also I got a watermelon smoothie, very refreshing.

Only downside is they are pretty slow to make your order. But it‚Äôs more than worth the wait."

I got the Katsu Chicken Curry Rice, Passion fruit popping boba, and a few drinks from their cooler that I thought looked nice.
I HIGHLY recommend the Curry. It bursts on your tongue as soon as it hits it, the flavor goes through your mouth like nothing you've ever felt. I wish I had this place right next to my house so I could have it everyday."

However I asked for my all time favourite brown sugar and they all looked at me like I was stupid and said they‚Äôve never heard of that before. Anyway I ended up getting a vanilla tea and it was horrible. They took about 10 minutes or so to make this and it took all 3 of them to figure out what to do and how to make it.  Spending ¬£5 on a drink that was disgusting just ruined my day. The customer service was just awkward with a big sign saying we don‚Äôt tolerate abuse when mannerism was exactly that.

The chicken curry had a strange smell and was more like a stew and the kids meals were very plain and basic.
The layout is very uncomfortable, I get they want to get as many customers as possible. But it's soo squashed it's not a pleasant experience at all. 3 people had to stand up from their meals to let us get out. Way too many tables.

Staff are friendly and service quick, but I think that's because unless you have a fry up, everything is just reheated precooked food."

Was really really impressed about their no takeaway cup to help the environment and reduce waste.
London,coffee shop,Monmouth Coffee Company,ChIJ94DTm1cDdkgRibmgxzXy2EQ,"2 Park St, London",4.5,Y N,"Monmouth Coffee at Borough Market is a must-visit for any coffee lover.

Vibes were chill and cosy, the cafe was decorated with Halloween themed props which was nice and festive.

Ordered an americano and a hazelnut croissant coming to a total of ¬£6.70, fairly affordable in the Victoria area. Americano was large for a regular size, hence good value for money. It's smooth and strong, no sour after taste which was exactly how I like my coffee. Croissant was alright, it had the subtle hint of lemon/ citrusy taste in the pastry which I don't usually like but the hazelnut/ Nutella filling made up with the nutty sweetness. Could have done with much more filling but it was a nice pastry overall.

Would be happy to come back regularly for their coffee and I want to try other pastries next time."

I understand the idea for the planet, but it can be a bit annoying, I won't lie. There‚Äôs a nice outside area with plenty of seating available, and it's non-smoking, which I appreciate.

She wasn‚Äôt nice to answer me then I help you to melt in the hot water, and I said thank you. I don‚Äôt want to ruin my mood to enjoy my coffee.

We also managed to sneak in a pain au suisse! We‚Äôve never heard of it before and it looked divine; it was sweet, chocolatey and crisp on the outside while moist on the inside!

They have a few other flavors that I‚Äôd be tempted to try but I‚Äôm not sure if they would be better than the pistachio one.

The oat milk cappuccino was yummy and was sweet enough that it didn‚Äôt need sugar. I think next time I‚Äôd get the flat white though.

¬£10 for coffee and a pastry."

Not very busy when we went. They have a nice selection of sweet and savoury food. Everything looks good, tastes good, coffee is a nice blend .
The salt beef bagel is a bit dry, could use something more than mustard.

The one thing that does stand out is the music. Totally inappropriate for this type is establishment. Doesn't go at all and kind of ruins a nice atmosphere.
Seriously, it needs changing. I don't want to enjoy a nice pastry and coffee with friends and have someone's in the background saying they want to bang a woman one more time on pop-tehno beats.

If you can stand the negatives, I'd recommend this cafe."

In the store, you can see the coffee beans roast and store up in tubes, as you order any coffee-based drink.

The location is a short walking distance from London bridge station (the exit that leads to the bus station), so I was able to pick something up and catch the train with ease.

Looking for a small, yet cosy place to work on those deadlines? This is a good place!

The barrister told me that they use ceremonial grade matcha which is what I was looking for and I ordered the iced matcha with oat milk & blueberry syrup (over ¬£5). It was one of the best matcha's I've had so far! It wasn't too sweet, not bland but just right & I was thinking of buying a second one after the first sip!

I bought a peruvian and ethiopian roasted coffee beans and when i made them at home the coffee came out really acid. I probably wouldnt recommend their beans for someone who is a coffee geek."

I chose a balanced roast and it was okay but i just don‚Äôt like hot coffee served in glass. I bet they do it for a reason.

But the trick is that I've always wanted to come in for a coffee, because the coffee shop looks very chic.  He even said very attractive, but it so happened that this time I still got into it.  I was very surprised by the design, as well as how this coffee establishment looks in everything, firstly, a very expensive design.  I would even say very nice, since there is coffee everywhere, a very pleasant smell of fresh fruit coffee, they bake themselves and sell them as well.  You can order some food right there they can make, I mean cook for you.  They have a very tasty omelette.  They have delicious sandwiches too.  You can order natural juice and taste what they do locally.  These, but in any case, I really liked the pleasant staff.But I will definitely go there.  Maybe not even one, so I recommend.  If you want to drink delicious coffee and be in a beautiful environment, then you should definitely come to this place."

Pearl 40 drink could use more jasmine flavor. Was expecting more of a coffee milk tea type of drink. Still delicious.

Note this place is very busy in the mornings. If no seats get your coffee to go and sit in the plaza just up the street."

Sweet coffee shop with lots of sweet treats and a small but delicious menu.

‚ÄèA coffee shop with a great vibe, really good coffee.

The coffee was a mild Peruvian roast when I visited it.
Pour over was always my favourite and the flat white
I did not like the coconut pastry I found it too dry. Banana bread was definitely a hit could be toasted too
The other pastries looked tasty but I did not try them. Service could also be a bit friendlier.

I'll be sure to return if I'm ever in the area again!"

From the moment you walk in, you‚Äôre greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere that feels like a cozy retreat from the bustling city. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and clearly passionate about what they do.

The coffee here is excellent- I got a pout over and was recommended some good beans each cup is crafted with care, showcasing the rich flavors and depth that make it clear they‚Äôre serious about their beans.

The staff are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and clearly passionate about what they do, making every visit a delight.

The coffee here is simply outstanding - I tried their signature pour-over, and it was perfectly balanced, with just the right amount of acidity and sweetness.

I also love the minimalist yet stylish decor, which provides a perfect backdrop for a relaxed coffee experience or a catch-up with friends. Whether you‚Äôre a coffee aficionado or just looking for a great cup, Nagara Coffee is a must-visit. It‚Äôs easily one of my favorite spots in London, and I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough!"

I've have cappuccino and it was intense and flavorful.  While my wife's flat white was quite smooth.

I'm glad I found this place cause I want a place where I can sit and just soak into jazzy music and enjoy some calmness in the morning.  Sure ease my mind before a busy day."

Impeccable service, really friendly and attentive staff and very talented and well trained.
Best coffees and matches, avo on toast and pastries. They do not have a kitchen as it is a small coffee shop so no eggs.
And seating is hard wood, but otherwise very conveniently located right at exit of Battersea Park train station, on the bus stop.
Highly recommended."

But for us the best is their toasted banana bread, it is worth the trip as well as their high-quality coffee making!! It is always really busy, with just about 12 sitting spaces!"
London,coffee shop,Nostos Coffee,ChIJoe9JnRUFdkgRl4xa0jriGJI,"Next to, Battersea Park Railway Station, 10a Battersea Park Rd, London",4.9,Katie Ball,"Food:  I was given a choice of 2 beans for my double espresso with an explanation of both.  I had ‚Äúavo on toast‚Äù which was served with colourful pomegranate seeds and mint which was an interesting touch.  I prefer my avocado in slices rather than guacamole but that is just subjective nitpicking on my part.
Service:  Smiley, friendly, efficient & informed about what they were serving and how they were serving it.
Atmosphere:  Small and vibrant.  Local shop vibes with inoffensive generic guitar music in the background.  I was there at around 8am and it was busy with what appeared to be loyal locals of the 2 legged and the 4 legged variety.  They even had a water bowl for dogs in their little outside seating space."
London,coffee shop,Nostos Coffee,ChIJoe9JnRUFdkgRl4xa0jriGJI,"Next to, Battersea Park Railway Station, 10a Battersea Park Rd, London",4.9,Kimi S,"I was excited to visit Nostos as a coffee lover, but unfortunately, I was left disappointed. While the staff was friendly and welcoming, the overall experience fell short of expectations. The coffee itself had bright, juicy notes, but there was no variety of beans to choose from, or at least I was not informed of any options.

The space was very small with limited seating, and when I took out a tablet to read, I was informed that laptops and tablets are not allowed during weekends. While I understand the need for such policies, they should be clearly communicated to customers before they sit down or make a purchase. Given the size and atmosphere of the cafe, it didn‚Äôt feel particularly work-friendly to begin with, so the policy was surprising.

Overall, Nostos feels more suited as a take-away shop, where more space could be dedicated to the baristas, and a stronger focus could be placed on the variety of coffee beans. As it stands, the cafe lacks the space and ambiance to serve as a cosy place to stay in for a coffee."

It's recommended for cafe lovers

Besides cafe, that have a few pantries (croissants etc.), most of which are made of plant based sources. See images.

While I understand (from other reviews) that they use speciality cafe beans, I'm not that of a connoisseur to know the difference. It's clear though that they know what they are doing!

London,coffee shop,58 LONG LANE,ChIJ5yGJbrAbdkgRPVmiy6ptGmQ,"58 Long Ln, London",4.9,Lift_Run_Eat_,Unfortunately a milky mess. They use Ozone beans but it really doesn‚Äôt come through. It takes more than just sourcing specialty coffee to make a place good.

I asked the barista which coffee (filter or latte) he would recommend, and after explaining what kind of coffee they were. He offered to let me try some of the filter and while I got the latte.
Both were very delicious and unique in their own way. The latte was smooth and naturally sweet. The filter had a unique strong flavor. I enjoyed both very much.
I also had a cinnamon bun with the coffee, which was nice but not flaky enough for my taste.

Poor selection of milk and milk alternatives- staff didn‚Äôt really know what I was talking about when I asked for lactose free milk (no, not plant based, but regular lactose free milk). I thought that was odd.
And finally, not environmentally friendly place - I order in, they served in takeaway cup anyway. Shame.
A place to hang out as the music was nice, BUT DEFINITELY NOT for the real coffee lovers."

I ordered a flat white which was deliciously smooth and had some fruity notes. The baristas definitely know how to make a good cup of coffee.
London,coffee shop,Bad Coffee,ChIJv0sZBP0ddkgRQl55MR03Si0,"Bad Coffee 9, Oslo House, Prince Edward Rd, London",4.9,D C,"I had a very good cappuccino here this morning. The good points:

1. Gave me no lid on the take away cup. I like this because it's taking a positive stand against plastic waste!

2. Price was ¬£3.20 which is good value

3. Finally, the coffee tasted pretty much perfect, just the right strength and size.

I shall be making this a regular stop for my coffees, I just hope it tastes this good every time!!!"

However today I wasn‚Äôt even able to order - I joined the queue behind one couple who I soon realised already had their coffee and were just chatting, which I have absolutely no issue with. The person working saw me, and the couple saw me (the woman even making a move to try and get out from in front of me to let me order), but the person working had no interest and ignored these cues and kept chatting. I want to emphasise I have no issue with friendly service or catch-ups, I just wish the person working had paused to take my order and start my coffee while chatting to them as most coffee shops/local shops do (balance customer needs). Instead she completely ignored me so after a minute I just left. I then watched them do this to another customer that attempted to join the queue! Unfortunately do not feel comfortable spending my money here anymore as it was truly bizarre to be ignored"

If you're going on the weekend I would definitely reccomend booking as it was very busy when we were there.

Goes without saying really but the coffee was also excellent as well as being of a larger size (closer in quantity to the usual chain coffee stores than some of the independent coffee shops), and I would definitely reccomend it - even if you don't want to eat in there's a window near the entrance for you to order things to take away"

The space is clean, buzzing with energy and good coffee ( I‚Äôm Italian, from Naples, and I can recognise a great coffee when I taste or smell one), and serving the nicest breakfast in the most pleasant environment. The service is very good and friendly, they treat everybody as if they are long lost friends waiting to catch up since ages, and the quality of their Eggs Royale ( my favourite breakfast thing to order ) is outstanding. They also serve a very good full English breakfast and some variations they you can build up as you please. The avocado on toast is also really good, the wu  as lot of everything they cook is just beyond your average breakfast spot. Special mention also to the sausage rolls, if they are not sold out you must get whatever they have on display they are a cut above any other sausage roll you tasted before. Lastly, even the choice of waters is good with San Pellegrino and Evian, 2 of my all time favourites. During the weekend there is always a queue, so I suggest either to go early or late or to ho midweek when it is still busy but there are no long queues."

I feel compelled to address the recent reviews concerning this exceptional cafe and its staff, which I find unfair. As a loyal patron since their opening, I can attest that these reviews do not accurately reflect the true nature of this establishment.

This locally run coffee shop has been a valued cornerstone of our community, consistently delivering outstanding service and high-quality offerings. The welcoming and warm atmosphere is a direct result of the dedication and hard work of the staff.

Regarding the waiter in question, my experiences have always been exemplary. The waiter, along with the entire team, exhibits professionalism, courtesy, and a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction. These qualities are what keep me and many others coming back.

Had I not been on a facetime to my son, I would have intervened to support the staff and the establishment.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly support this cafe and its team. Their consistent excellence and dedication to their patrons deserve recognition and appreciation, not baseless criticism."

What I was greeted with was horrible service with an attitude which seemed to only get worse once I didn‚Äôt add a tip to my order.

Does this make me regret ordering and providing those individuals with business in this difficult economy? Yes it honestly does‚Ä¶

I love the spinach and feta pie, so rich in filling, the fresh orange pie and the salad. Their portions are great value for money and so filling. Must pop in if you are around and dog friend üëå"

I could excuse slow service at that time since they were very busy, but the second time I came was a different story. I came on a Thursday afternoon - not particularly busy. My order was taken, but I had to wait 20 minutes to receive my coffee (a simple flat white). I at first didn't think much of it, but then I noticed that people who had arrived after me had already received their drinks. It turns out they had totally forgotten about my order! No apology, no explanation, just a ""You wanted a flat white, right?"" and then it turned up 3 minutes later.
Ultimately, the coffee is okay, especially for the price, and the atmosphere is pretty nice for socialising (on quieter days)... you just have to expect slow service."

Especially in busy, central locations. The lady serving us was all time smiling and lovely. Had to deal with  lots of customers in busy Saturday afternoon but done it with grace and constant smile. Kudos to her!
The chai coffee latte was delicious. Cake standard.
Interior is ok.
They add service charge on top of a bill but this was deserved although I had only coffee with cake, no food."

The cafe is small with outdoor seating. The service is quite slow. My tea was fine, but my partner's hot chocolate had no flavour.

They are very efficient and accommodating. They made sure that the details of my order were correct and don‚Äôt just assume. Asia verified first if I was fine with the whip cream as it wasn‚Äôt vegan even though it was actually a part of the ingredients and I appreciate it very much because it shows concern :) They don‚Äôt just make coffee, they honestly made a good experience."

We were in London for nine days, and we went to Origin three times. The staff was friendly, the service was fast, and the coffee was wonderful. We got pour over coffees twice, and I enjoyed receiving a card that listed all the information about the coffee on it. The almond croissant was splendid, and the cardamom bun is a must try."

The other day, I had a hot chocolate. It was delightful and not overly sweet, just right.
The green tea was different from the usual Japanese variety, more like a herbal tea, but still quite lovely."

The filter batch brew of the day was a delicious Nicaraguan coffee that was nutty and not bitter at all. I paired it with a flaky croissant, which was good too. (Total ¬£7)

It‚Äôs an open space sitting arrangement, that fills up quickly. The atmosphere is modern, the music fits perfectly with the easy going vibe.

I opted for an Oat Latte - which was excellent, and I was seriously tempted by their yummy looking selection of cakes & biscuits too!

The coffee shop itself is tiny, but there is some seating inside and outside. Because the weather was so hot when I visited, I decided to sit outside in the shade and enjoy my coffee.

Lovely little coffee shop, and really sweet staff too. Definitely worth visiting."

Lots of healthy options and locally sourced food with freshly made different salads each day and unusual things like the remarkably good chorizo flavour scotch eggs which are very light and nothing like a typical scotch egg.  Amazing cakes and pastries.  Asking for a cup of tea becomes an experience with a teapot and a jug of milk - very nice touch.  You access through the grand entrance of the building and wend your way down to the lower level so it‚Äôs a fascinating insight behind the scenes of this historic building and nothing not like a typical coffee shop."

I thought I‚Äôd missed it on the street but indeed there it was- there is no sign on the street and you have to check in at concierge who then show you the way down to the cafe. Really great to sit and work or explore the books. Many people were in meetings but it was still quite quiet and pleasant. The pasty and coffee were spot on. So unique!

When I asked that it be put in a takeaway cup, it was begrudgingly put in a takeaway cup, as if I was asking a special favour.

London,coffee shop,Notes Coffee Roasters & Bar | Kings Cross,ChIJLcHcSzwbdkgR47eIUqcxBtY,"1 Pancras Rd, London",3.6,Mair√©ad H,"Firstly, there is a service charge added to the bill, for almost non existent service.
I ordered the devilled mushrooms and poached egg, with orange juice. The egg was overcooked, and the juice was very sweet. Almost like soap.
After brunch, I bought a muffin to go. Again, it was overcooked and dry. So it seems the food in general is just bad.

The service is minimal. I was just casually told to sit upstairs, and left waiting for 15 minutes on somebody to take my order. The only interaction I had with staff was the brief dismissal of ""there's seats upstairs"" and the taking of, and delivery of my order. An included service charge for this interaction is disgraceful.
Definitely wouldn't recommend."

The decor is absolutely gorgeous, with eye catching posters and prints and bud lights sprinkled across the entire ceiling.

N,"In this area, there are many cafes targeted at tourists, but the service and the taste of the food often don't quite live up to expectations. Initially, we had similar thoughts as we decided to step into this caf√© for a beer and maybe some chips. The staff inside warmly showed us to our seats and took our orders with big smiles. While I wished the beer had been a bit colder, the Lobster Bacon Sandwich we ordered was incredibly delicious, pleasantly simple, meticulously prepared, and even had a cute Swiss flag decoration. The lobster was fresh, and its pairing with avocado was spot on.

Eating the sandwich, it became evident that this caf√© puts a lot of care into their food, making us confident that choosing this place was the right decision. Later, we ordered warm Apple Strudel, Prosecco, and Hot Coffee. At $3 for drip coffee in this area, it's very reasonable! The taste was delightful and rich.

The warm apple strudel was made with great attention, not overly sweet, with a crispy crust and a melt-in-your-mouth filling‚Äîarguably the best apple pie in New York! I'll definitely come back here, aiming to try the Lobster Bisque that everyone praises. Until next time!"

The weather was gorgeous. The restaurant appears to have nice outdoor dining accommodations but we dined in side the restaurant.

The interior of the restaurant creates a nice atmosphere; it feels very comfortable and certainly not cramped. The service was never nice and prompt. The food was fine; not great or bad which seems fairly consistent with most of the dining places in this neighborhood.

I would come back here again as pre-movie spot but I likely would not go out of my way to find a reservation on any other occasion."

We've paid 32$ for 1 bagel, 1 pancake, 1 small tea and 1 large cappuccino once all taxes and credit card extra fees included (which does not really make this place cheaper than others spots in the same area from our experience)."

He offered another empanada with beef or chicken but I got my money back. Staff was good but not the food was not acceptable
CHECK YOUR FOOD FIRST! 0/5 stars

The best pizza and bakery me and my wife have had here. They even have seating upstairs. The prices are great and the service was amazing. They even asked if I wanted my cinnamon roll heated up. Everywhere else just slides it to you and looks like why are you still here. Do yourself a favor and check out Berlina Cafe on W 39th St and 8th Ave."

The workers here were very nice and accommodating. They brought our food up to us and were pretty helpful with what we needed.  They have a seating area downstairs and upstairs for larger parties. The price is what you would expect for NY. The pizza was ok. Thin sliced, good proportions and had a good taste. The place was clean, and the other patrons seemed to be enjoying their visit as well. They had a variety of choices and some amazing looking desserts.  I would recommend this place for a quick bite or emergency pick me up for hungry kids!"

Has a beautiful outdoor space out back that reminds of a vacation affair. It has nice seating inside as well. Somewhat of a romantic place but also family friendly. Pricey but that is expected. The lady at the counter was so nice, gave her suggestions and told us which ones have alcohol since we were obviously Muslim. Appreciated that."

Food took forever, I requested chocolate milk for my kids and I barely got a half a cup. It was like a quarter of a cup. I ordered a burger and requested that there is no bun just lettuce and they gave me one tiny leaf of lettuce on the bottom of the burger. The place is overcrowded. Bread is so soggy The food is not good at all. Eggs were very runny and undercooked. Service Took forever. There is only one bathroom in this place and it is so disgusting. They use cheap sausages you get from like the dollar store. This place is mediocre rather go to Roca Caf√©."

New York,cafe,Omonia Cafe,ChIJt6V79VhFwokRHA6HrhjjFV8,"7612-14 3rd Ave, Brooklyn",4.2,Mohammed Alsalman,"I headed to this bakery on a very glooming dark, rainy Monday, I had just finished an appointment and wanted to treat myself to somewhere nice and read my book in peace.
I‚Äôm not as familiar with the bay ridge area, as I don‚Äôt head to south brooklyn as much not have that many cafes/bakeries in my list there.

I was searching for somewhere nice, and Omonia‚Äôa popped in my search list.
All i can say is that it was much more than i expected for. I walked into a very warm and cozy bakery-diner style, with a plethora of sweets, pastries, cookies,cakes, baklava, and more! I was stick for about 5 minutes unsure on what to order, even with the help of one of their waitresses, really they had so many delicious looking options that I was overwhelmed with them.

Finally after a lot of thinking and recommendations from the waitress ( very nice and pleasant person, really helped me with their options) I was able to settle on getting three different betefore cookies ( butter cookies) and a Portokalopita cake;  which had the perfect texture and moisture, absolutely perfect!

I was fairly disappointed that they didn‚Äôt have any strong quality chai, as by the look of the place it was middle eastern, but they did serve chai which was good, but no without evaporated milk, i was served some warm milk instead which was still decent.

I sat in one of their cozy booths on the side, I had quite therapeutic and calm reading session at Omonia their Portokalopita was very juicy and delicious, the way they extracted the orange really brought out all the flavor in the Portokalopita

As for their betefour, it had the perfect about of crumble, not too sweet either which was perfect, i forgot exactly what was the filling but if i‚Äôm most mistaken it was cranberry which made the cookie even better!

Their chai as I said wasn‚Äôt amazing, but it was okay and had some strong flavor, no zaffron sadly but the portion of the chai was nice, a whole teapot for about 8 dollars!
Frankly speaking for the price i paid it was more than perfect, I spent about 17 for all of this.

Overall speaking I really loved my experience at Omonoia, would definitely recommend coming here to my friends!

Also, service here is really nice, the staff are very friendly and helping people. Very patient people who really want to serve their customers in the best way they can!"

The loaded people could care less but it annoys the heck out of me.

Cooks are rarely there to take your order which is the norm in nyc, ok for a quick bite but fluctuating prices are the biggest pet peeve of mine in the city so I can not recommend."

The moment the guy behind the counter offered to make a fresh pot of coffee, I became a lifelong customer.  The coffee was SO GOOD!

Since my life partner and I were on our way to a gathering, we did not have the time to explore everything else they have, but on the surface, Cafe Bravo seems a lot like a convenience store.

Still, if they have seating and a bathroom, I look forward to dining in, the next time I visit."

Son Philly cheese stake wrap, which was tasty, filling alot, but heavy. I went for regular western omelette with exchange pf potato for fruit salad for 2usd. Daughter had some pancakes, probably the weakest dish. Bacon is very tasty, well prepared how it should be. One thing spoiled the experience. They add automatically 18% tip. I know it is NY, but for breakfast service, nothing special, at the place that seems local, friendly, for a European it is a surprise. It simply does not feel right they force an additional almost 20%. Everyone leaves something. This thing about this place we did not like. Not for morning 40 minute simple breakfast. It made the whole value wrong. Instead of 90 usd bill you get almost 110 for breakfast (4 people). We fed the 5th person with this. Increase the prices and let people decide whether they tip you, how much or not."

Just know if you‚Äôre eating at a sit-down restaurant in the city, you‚Äôre gonna pay a bit more. Bacon, 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and blueberries= $25 + tip. Still a great place for breakfast among the many places in this city. And their sign says breakfast served all day."

Not only was it beautiful but it was also decadent and delightful with every bite without being overpoweringly rich. The cafe also had indoor seating which was nice but upon exiting I discovered they also have a really nice outdoor seating area that makes me want to return and experience this ‚Äúoasis‚Äù with my family!

I‚Äôve stopped by here before after seeing the beautiful display of desserts and baked goods and realized there was a whole restaurant inside!

Finally came for their food - they have both indoor and outdoor seating, but we opted for indoor for the AC. Seating is very spacious and aesthetically pleasing.

Their menu offers salads, pizzas, burgers, paninis and grilled meats. I got their chicken souvlaki with a side of Greek salad. Only complaint is the chicken was a bit dry.

A great spot to come catch up with friends for a light lunch or coffee for the ambiance."

The drinks and food were amazing. My only compliant was how long it took for our food to come -  way over 45 mins, probably because it was on a Sunday. Nevertheless I would recommend this cute spot."
New York,cafe,The Oasis Cafe,ChIJO7ZEFdBhwokR0QSRhPN3P8I,"196-30 Northern Blvd, Flushing",4.3,B L,"The space is beautiful.The experience there is something else. We arrived and ask for a non-smoking table because the first time we were there with my kids, we were seated in the smoking section of the restaurant. Is this even legal in NYC? Anyway, this time around we were directed to the most 'odd' tables as if we were profiled based on skin color! We had to ask to be seated elsewhere as the one offered were cramped and hidden in the back. My kids were not very happy seated where we are as they were attacked by dozens of mosquitoes. We notified the server and he signaled a busboy to spray the back of the seats where mosquitoes breed behind curtains of bamboo plants. It was really bad and to the point of being uncomfortable to dine at this restaurant. We asked to be allocated to another table but was rudely declined. We were told that the empty tables were reserved. Just that, reserved. Nothing to offer as an option. Back to our seats, the busboys were delightful and very prompt with water pitcher and glasses. Our server was pleasant, hence, the four stars for the service. We ordered some soft drinks and some cocktails for the adults. The cocktails were meh. Have had better ones for the price Oasis charged.

Now, to the food.ZERO stars describes the horrible food that was served. Chicken, cheese sticks and onion rings must have been fried many times over! The chicken were dry, the onion rings were overly battered and dry, the cheese sticks were unbelievably dry and the chicken wings were tough and dry. My guess is these items were pre-fried and then fried again before serving. Not worth the price they charged. Absolutely NOT. Will not be returning. Sad, as I really wanted to like this spot. I was going to celebrate a friend's birthday next week, we collectively decided to go a better restaurant."

Had the Quattro Formaggi ravioli, came with a side of bread to sop up the tasty alfredo sauce. This place has everything - great cafe, plus a mini food hall type menu. Everything from burgers to pasta and fried chicken, but unlike some places that can't do variety equally well, literally everything here knocks it out of the park. Wonderful service and hospitality, the owner/chef Eder is a hospitality machine and tremendous cook. My bad android camera doesn't do it justice but you gotta try this place out!"
New York,cafe,VINTAGE CAFE,ChIJYZkAG6BZwokRtF1U7_9ZaJ4,"102 E 7th St, New York",4.1,K,"Waited 1 hour for 1 breakfast sandwich during my lunch break. They‚Äôre understaffed and abrasive. Very odd experience!

It took 6 tries to order because Annette at the register kept abruptly walking away to assist other people mid-sentence. Additionally, they only sell some items before a certain time, and some after. They act annoyed if you order something outside their time frames even though they don‚Äôt have that info on their menus. Put the time frames on your menus!

They also had items on the menu that were unavailable like their avocados aren‚Äôt ripe so none of the avocado items were available. Take them off the menu if unavailable.

Related to the wait, there was only one order ahead of me, and they served a party that came after ahead of me. A BLT shouldn‚Äôt take 1 hour to make.

One man only ordered a bagel with cream cheese and waited a long time before the other woman who served it blamed him and said, ‚ÄúThis is a breakfast item and it‚Äôs lunch time so that‚Äôs why it took so long. Just so you know for next time.‚Äù

There was only 1 woman making the food and 1 taking orders. They need more staff if they can‚Äôt handle it.

The woman at the register waited until after I paid to tell me it would take ‚Äúa while.‚Äù Tell people prior so they don‚Äôt waste their time and can go elsewhere."

We stopped in for just a coffee and a shot of bourbon and some time to write and talk, but the atmosphere was what really stood out.

The old boxer photos lining the walls gave it a nostalgic charm, and the staff was genuinely friendly. Whether you're there for a quick drink or to soak in the history, it‚Äôs a timeless gem in the heart of SoHo.

You can definitely feel the old school charm here and you definitely want to taper your expectations but for me, it's the sort of old, beautiful, beat up that I like."

The tiramisu was made in-house with espresso, custard cream, and cocoa powder on top - such a nice touch and the flavors blended perfectly. The espresso martini, however, seemed a bit under-mixed and separated.

Still, the cozy cafe-bar vibe and friendly server made for an enjoyable experience. Next time, I'll have to try their food offerings too!"

New York,cafe,Old Fashion Caf√©,ChIJwSslRhxZwokRBLkPiFyDWHM,"110 Thompson St, New York",4.6,Jeremy Hawkins,"Would have given 0 stars if possible: humiliating and scary experience. I have been sober for 14 years. On their menu it says cocktails can be made non-alcoholic. When ordering a virgin bloody mary I said to the waitress: ‚ÄúI do not drink alcohol. I have been sober for 14 years and am an alcoholic. Please make sure this is virgin.‚Äù When she returned she said, ‚ÄúHere is your mocktail.‚Äù

After drinking about a third of it, I started to feel funny. I approached the bartender and asked him if the we Bloody Mary that he had just made was a virgin. He replied: ‚Äúno.‚Äú

Server was not apologetic, bartender was not apologetic, and in fact the server just pawned us off on another server and never approached us again.

And when I brought it up with the manager at the end of the meal, asking for just my meal to be comped in a party of six he said ‚Äúabsolutely not: we took the drink off of the bill, and made you another drink‚Äù ‚Äî (which I didn‚Äôt accept as I would not drink anything from that bar) ‚Äî ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all we‚Äôre going to do.‚Äù

He then proceeded to lecture me about how busy it is on Saturday and that it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal and that he really shouldn‚Äôt have to do this. It was like they had brought me ketchup when I asked for mayo.

He then looked at my party and asked them: ‚ÄúAre you with him or are you with me?‚Äù They obviously replied they were with me.

He left and returned shortly and grabbed the credit card out of my friend‚Äôs hand, without telling us that he had begrudgingly taken my French toast dinner off the bill.

Did I get angry? Yes. Did I yell when I was belittled and shut down? Absolutely. Did I threaten to not pay the whole bill, to which I was informed the cops would be called on me? You betcha. But I have never been treated so terribly and dismissively in my life.

Horrific dehumanizing experience. This place does not care about their customers. Stay away."

I like their red bean fish things, tho sometimes they can be kind of crunchy? Either way it‚Äôs a nice spot on a weekday to get some work done. Weekends definitely not. Parking sucks. Not sure why the clothing store has like 10 spots and the cafe only 2? Also it‚Äôs a lil dangerous turning in from Northern Blvd because it‚Äôs a two way and it‚Äôs very tight to turn in as many cars are also trying to turn onto Northern as well, so gotta be careful or take a different route. Parking around is residential so it‚Äôs not too difficult to find a spot if you‚Äôre okay with walking a bit."

Otherwise, the sandwiches are good and they have a nice variety of fresh baked Korean pastries and tons of different drinks. I do wish they had a decent matcha though‚Ä¶ whatever they are using tastes super cheap and comes out so fast it may be instant powder."

However, service was incredibly slow, where it took over 20 minutes to get my drink. I got the red bean latte which was mild in flavor, which could be improved with a bit more red beans. It's a nice and comfortable place to hang out at but just make sure you aren't in a rush.

The number one thing about this place is the staff. Typically they greet you when you come in, which feels very welcoming. Furthermore, I love their wide selection of drinks and snacks. The coffee is pretty tasty along with their snacks. Usually I find a seat, and they have a decent amount of outlets.

Prices can be sneaky, $4.75 easily goes above $5 and some change with tax, so if you're a broke student definitely proceed with caution. Definitely worth it in my opinion if you consider it as a day-pass to sit down and chat/study."

However, when I went to pick up the meal, I found that the coffee was of normal size.  After communicating with the staff, I changed the big cup, but it also wasted my time.  I found that Vietnamese bread also has a big problem while driving. The beef in the roast beef Vietnamese bread I ordered is similar to canned luncheon meat, one by one. I went back to the shop again to communicate with the staff, they really  Very rude and savage to the guests. First of all, they said that their beef Vietnamese bread is like this. It was my fault. I made a mistake. Secondly, if I want to change, I need to pay again and wait ten minutes.  The time in the morning is too precious. I don‚Äôt think I will repurchase anymore. The service in this shop is really terrible, and the food is not as delicious as before. I don‚Äôt think anyone wants to spend ten dollars to buy a piece of bread with carrot  , The ratio of 90% shredded radish and 10% beef is really ridiculous!  And it's not real beef, it's canned beef!"

Seems like they are the only study cafe besides Starbucks. Yelp, Google Maps, and their front door sign all state that they open at 10 AM. I decided to come early at 9:55 AM to see if they were open early as I had a lot of work to do.  When I got there, the doors were locked so I waited outside. 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 minutes later I was still waiting outside. Another group that was waiting with me called and were told that they open at 11 AM. Makes no sense when Yelp, google, and even their website says they open at 10. There was like 5 employees sitting inside since 10 while we continue to wait outside until they decided to unlock the doors at 1045. Probably not coming back here again but the coffee was not bad."

PS: 4 stars for the atmosphere because the shop is a tiny tiny hole in a wall. There is a counter seating that can fit maybe 4-5 people tops.  You may not find a space to sit. But still worth a visit."

The atmosphere is vibrant and welcoming, making it the perfect spot for a night out or a relaxed evening. The menu offers a wide variety of delicious drinks and dishes.

What really stood out, though, was the exceptional service. The manager goes above and beyond to ensure every guest feels welcomed and taken care of. The bartender is incredibly skilled and crafted some of the best cocktails I‚Äôve ever had. Their attention to detail and friendly demeanor truly made the night special.

Atmosphere: The decor in this place is remarkable and well organized. It has good lighting and is pretty clean. It was also interestingly odd to see a connection with the laundromat next door. I'm not sure if that was a great idea, especially because it seems like this restaurant wants to stand out in the area.

Service: Acceptable

Food: This part was not really what I expected it to be. I mean, the quality is there. Ingredients seem to be fresh. However, the flavors are not quite there. At least, that's what I experienced with my order. I ordered the Bee Breakfast Sandwich, the Double Pork Buns, the Crispy Spring Rolls, and the Tiramisu. The sandwich was okay, just that, there's not much to say about it. The pork buns were small, not much meat but fat. The spring rolls were better than the rest of things I ordered to be honest. Finally, the tiramisu was average.

Price: If both, quality and flavors were really good, prices wouldn't be a problem. In this case, the lack of flavors does not compensate their prices."

The matcha latte was borderline ""just ok."" I saw the person take out a bowl, so I thought, ""ok good it's real matcha that they are going to grind."" Later on, the drink came out and I thought it did not look green enough, and there was not enough of a matcha taste.

The interior decor was cute, even though most plants were plastic.

So, I would say 3.5 ‚≠ê for food, but I'm going to say 3 ‚≠ê. Nevertheless, the cute decor and service were good enough that I would give 4 ‚≠ê overall."

I didn't see any outlets on the patio.

The croissant was a solid 2/5. It felt like the croissant was sliced in half of microwave with the ham and cheese. I was disappointed . The ham had a lot of inedible bits to it.

The coffee tasted burnt. The espresso shot wasn't pulled nicely.

Place could be cleaner.

40 minute dining in limit signs were posted around the place. Not sure if enforced."

Absolutely NO seasoning on it , the waffle was fluffy with a hint of something spicy and the syrup was tasteless.

My visit recently, in my opinion, was long overdue. This place is just as I remembered it. The food was good and plentiful, and the service was great. This is such a cute spot that offers both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a very extensive food and beverage menu, and they offer brunch all day. Everyone who dines in gets a number assigned to them to have the food and drinks brought out to them to their table. I ordered the Poblano Chipotle Omelet, and it had the right amount of heat and wasn't too spicy. The potatoes that came with the order tasted great too and had good flavor.  The staff is friendly, and the establishment is kept pretty clean. I will definitely come back again, but I will make sure I won't take so long the next time to have another great meal here."

Overall though, a bit dissatisfied. Found it to be slightly pricey given the portion size and overall quality i guess. Not bad but nothing special or outstanding either in my opinion. Staff was friendlyish, could of been better as they didnt give me any napkins or utensils just the one knife stabbed through the breakfast bun.

Generally just unimpressed, probably wouldnt come again to be honest."

I had the Persian Shakshuka - which I‚Äôve never heard of, let alone had before - and inhaled the entire thing. The incorporation of Iranian spices and Saffron truly balances the flavors out so well.

The ambiance is also charmingly quaint and cozy. They do have a no laptop policy so, sadly, you won‚Äôt be able to get any work done here, but it helps preserve its serene feeling.

I pulled up my google map cafe list and there popped this sweet delight.

I headed inside quick and found myself scattered onto the different type of pastries they had, but finally was able to settle on getting their delightful persian jewel. I paired that with a nice iced latte.

I‚Äôd have to say the coffee and pastry definitely did hit and were very neatly made; which make my whole shopping experience after much more pleasant and refreshing.

Overall this cafe seemed like a nice on the run cafe that served and definitely would come back here again!"

Ham & Cheese Croissant.  My daughter's favorite.  It really isn't your average ham & cheese.   The Turkey and Avocado sandwich was my choice.   Even though it  was number three of the three sandwiches, it was also delicious.   My number 1 was The Nipce Sandwich.  The salami makes it salty, but the sweetness of the arugula really evens the taste out.   I don't usually eat a runny egg on a sandwich, but on this sandwich,  I wouldn't have it any other way.   I will order it every time‚ù£Ô∏è OH! The homemade Apple Crumble Pie.  DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT A SLICE!  I got one for my husband and I, but I wish I'd gotten two."

There is plenty of seating and good for groups. This coffee shop boasts a small menu along with some pastry offerings. There is also outdoor seating.

I wasn't crazy about the food I got, but I can be a little picky, so I don't fault the restaurant for that (for example, my wife loved the desserts, I wasn't a fan). The main negative was it ended up being a bit on the pricy side, probably closer to $40-50 a person if you count drinks and dessert. Tap water was not available, only bottled."

We came here for breakfast this past Saturday 7.6.24 myself, Little Bit and my grandkids it was like pulling teeth to get more simple syrup for my Arnold Palmer and when I asked specifically that my Eggs Benedict 'poached' eggs be prepared runny... I received a look of ""well of duh"" yet they weren't runny. I will say this though the hollandaise sauce was on POINT and the bacon was good too. My bad that I didn't realize (nor apparently read) that it didn't come with a crumpet or english muffin as it's vessel LOL

The french toast was sooooo good too oh and the breakfast potatoes Manifique! All in all if you are in the area and you want something tasty that hit's the spot in your tummy come here! Street parking can be found and it's a short walk from the subway station. They have outdoor seating but we moseyed our way down the steps to where the restaurant was and sat inside. They had a communal table as well as 2 tops and (1) 4 in the rear by the restroom. Air conditioning too for these hot summer months is always a plus while dining.

It has phenomenal natural lighting, tasteful exposed brick inside, and varied seating.  Great natural lighting: half the space features floor to ceiling windows. Variety of seating: if you‚Äôre lucky, you can snag a spot on the two couches in the back nook. There‚Äôs also a few padded seats in the main area. Cafe square tables like the inside, bar stool seating lines the windows, and if you any to soak up the sun, there‚Äôs even 5/6 patio spots. The drip coffee is surprisingly very solid. They didn‚Äôt show the beans they use or know the brand of the roasters, but they did know it was from Colombia: a medium roast. The coffee was a medium dark roast: actually ended up being highly drinkable and quite chocolatey. Great casual vibes here: hang-out, read a book, grab a bite, chat it up, maybe bust out the laptop. Additional amenities: indie music bops, bathroom, and water on tap. Drip coffee score: 4/5. Everything else score: 5/5. Overall Score: 5/5."

I thought it would be a good place to buy something on my way to work in the morning. I just wanted mozzarella, cheese, tomato and lettuce in a plain bagel. I asked if you could make toast and they said okay. It definitely tasted awful. The toast bread tasted like fried pork. I don't eat pork or meat and I tried to eat some of the bagel, I thought maybe I was misunderstanding, but I threw half of it away. It was never worth this price. The taste was very bad.

I haven‚Äôt tried the smoothie yet but it will be on my list for sure. The sandwich displayed is the Notorious BLT and I substituted the chicken salad with a chicken cutlet and toasted the croissant. The Caprese breakfast sandwich on a croissant toasted is also very good but I always finish it before I can get a picture.

Giving three stars though because of how consistently slow the service is. For simple orders like a coffee or bagel it routinely takes an inordinate amount of time; literally 5x as long as a comparable shop. I live nearby and have stopped doing pop-ins here because it takes so long (even when I am the only customer). Easier to go somewhere else or make at home. The quality is good, but if you're on the move not worth the extensive wait. Best suited for a lazy weekend morning"

Visually, it seemed perfect, but upon visiting and ordering a cappuccino, I was disappointed. I ordered a small cappuccino, assuming it would be served in a cup (8 ounces) with a decorative pattern on the foam, on a saucer, with a tea spoon. What I got it was a large cup of warm milk, though with some foam on the top but without the pattern. A cappuccino is an espresso with a splash of milk and a thick layer of foam, not a cup of milk with a little splash of coffee! And it should be served in a small 8 not 12 or 16 ounces cup.

The stuff was friendly and nice but only one negative comment; there is no price tag for the coffee nor baked goods so I had to ask for the price for them. They were helpful though but was annoying a bit."

New York,cafe,PABADE CAFE AND BAKERY,ChIJA5NdQqn3wokRr1r5sTBrJZs,"135 E 110th St, New York",4.9,Mitali Vyas,"I recently visited this caf√© after reading some rave reviews, but unfortunately, my experience didn‚Äôt quite match the hype, especially when it came to their croissants. I tried the guava croissant, which had an interesting and enjoyable flavor combination, but the croissant itself was disappointing‚Äîvery doughy and bready rather than flaky, as a croissant should be.

As for the coffee, I was intrigued by their advertised ‚Äúmocha pot coffee,‚Äù expecting a traditional home-style Moka pot brew. However, it turned out to be more of a chocolate syrup mocha, which wasn‚Äôt what I had in mind. While the staff at the front desk were friendly and welcoming, the coffee and pastries left a lot to be desired.

If you‚Äôre looking for a flaky croissant and a robust cup of coffee in the Harlem area, I‚Äôd recommend walking a few blocks over to Super Nice Coffee. There‚Äôs definitely room for improvement here, and I hope to see some changes in the future."

Today, I had the best breakfast sandwich outside of my native South, the Buttermilk Biscuit with egg, actual cheddar cheese, and sausage. Big, hearty---excellent biscuit. I'm going to ask where they get them from next time I'm there or if they make them in-house. Loved, loved, loved it. Had a fresh pressed Cucumber Chill too, also good but an acquired taste methinks. UPDATE: returned a week later and had same biscuit but with bacon, ahhhh, bacon (my wife usu forbids it these days, shhhhh) and it was a again delicious, so they seem to be consistently good!"

I would let a lot of things slide (super greasy food, not listening to requests, eggshells in pretty much all my sandwiches), but recently they made a sandwich with meat that had gone bad. This resulted in my getting sick from it. I called them the next day and told them what happened and they refused to give me a refund. First they hung up on me. The second time I called I was just shooed off and told that I would be refunded but never did. I‚Äôm honestly shocked and disappointed by their behavior."

I got the Green Delight Breakfast sandwich which was a bit messy but 10/10 taste wise. My cousin got the Spicy Pleasure and while she liked hers she did feel like it wasn‚Äôt spicy enough so she ended up having to put hot sauce on it.
I also got the Chagamatcha latte (iced) and it was so good! This spot is reasonably priced for breakfast sandwiches and I would 100% come back here and try something different since every choice sounded amazing.

On my first visit, I ordered the breakfast pizza and a chai, and it was absolutely delicious. The pizza was perfectly balanced with fresh ingredients and just the right amount of cheese‚Äîan ideal way to start the day. The chai was warm, comforting, and spiced just right.

I couldn‚Äôt resist returning the next day, and this time I opted for the avocado toast with another chai. The avocado toast was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Paired with their consistently excellent chai, it made for a fantastic breakfast.

The atmosphere at Slate Cafe Nomad is cozy and inviting, making it the perfect place to relax, enjoy a meal, and sip on some chai. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this caf√© is a must-visit for a memorable breakfast experience. Highly recommended!"

This cafe is not child friendly, there were no high chairs or any other seating appropriate for little ones except the long bench.

The only comfortable place to sit is the long bench along the one wall, all the other chairs are either very small and the chairs with arms are also very small and hurt my thighs when I sat down.

I ordered a caramel iced coffee with almond milk with extra caramel. The coffee tasted like water. It had no flavor at all. I asked for a different drink and instead of just making me a new drink, I had to walk him through what to do to make a drink that would have some coffee and caramel flavor in it. Instead of making me a new drink he took the watered down drink added a shot of espresso more caramel and more milk and CHARGED me  EXTRA for the espresso!!!

I also ordered a BLT wrap. The tortilla was cold, like they didn‚Äôt warm it up at all, there was only 2 tiny piece of bacon, 2 little slices of tomato and an abundance of what I think was lettuce but also looked a bit like spinach.

1/5 Stars will never be going back"

Pros:
- Beautiful contemporary atmosphere with a touch of Rail art on the walls.
-  Ample of low and high seating space.
- Rich menu ranging from Avacado toast to the variety of omlette options. Mediterranean Omelette is a must have.
- Expresso bar with cold desserts.

Chair latte is pure milk and if you want to exchange your drink for $2 can of soda you‚Äôre not allowed to!"

Downtown JC is full of cute corner restaurants / bakeries, and Cafe Madelaine is a perfect example. It's a great spot for breakfast pastries, with plenty of room for indoor and outdoor seating.

Ironically, we came here right after spending a week in the South of France, and I have to say, Madelaine can hold its own. We shared the Leek and Parmesan Cheese Danish, the Raspberry Croissant and the Chocolate Jumelle. The first two were great quality, but the Jumelle was too thick and doughy for my liking.

Will be back to sample their amazing selection of quiches."

Biggest surprise was the menu we received was about half of what's listed on the website which was a bummer (ex: Mushroom Terrene wasn't available for us to order) but this could be chalked up to the fact it was Thanksgiving day.

Items we ordered as of 11/2023:
- Gnocchi - Cooked well but the portion size was pretty small especially for the price we paid (it's not listed on the online menu but we think it was over $20).

- Caf√© Burger - $26 - Pricey burger but came with a lot of fries. Wasn't a huge fan of the peppercorn aioli unfortunately (reminded me of a thick aus ju). I'd recommend asking them to hold off on the sauce or have it on the side).

- Classic Caesar - $18 - This was good. Well dressed and good size.  Didn't really taste the anchovy in the croutons though.

- Sorbet - $8 - Mango sorbet was good as was the strawberry (really can taste the fruit). Good palate cleanser!

- House cookies - $8 - Disappointing as it was 3 small cookies and they were on the harder side. Didn't seem to be freshly made (to me anyways).

Overall it was okay. Prices are typical for hotel food."

1.) Parma ham sandwich = yummy, appreciate they toast the bread just right
2.) Roll chicken hot dog = had this last time and was really impressed. The bread was toasted and was so fresh flakey with each bite

SERVICE:
Wonderful. Excellent. Always nice. üëå Appreciate they have a restroom as well. V important for a cafe. They also have free wifi.

ATMOSPHERE:
Very cozy, great bustling warm, with good number of small high tables, window seating, few outdoor seating as well. Always people here chatting, working, eating. On a very cozy small street of my fave the Village West/Greenwichch. Apparently, it has a direct view of the street Bob Dylan‚Äôs record album cover was photographed!

My inmune booster drink was delightful, in contrast with my avocado smash with turkey bacon - I should have accepted the waiter‚Äôs offer for salt and pepper - but my friend loved her Galaxy omelette with roasted potatoes which I will try on my next visit."

However, the coffee was a bit of a letdown. It was decent but not as good as I expected.

Overall, Luna Cafe is a wonderful place to visit. Despite the coffee not being the best, I‚Äôll definitely be back to enjoy more of their offerings!"

The guy taking our order Saturday was friendly and helpful. We got the frozen hot chocolate with soy milk (extra points for having soy milk!) and a couple desserts and a banana for the baby.

My partner hated his non vegan pastry, said it was too dry. But my vegan chocolate caramel crunch was very yummy! It was pretty big too so I just had half and finished the other half today.

When ordering the frozen hot chocolate, if you want it to be vegan, be sure to change the milk and also say no whipped cream!!

Would be even cooler if they had vegan whipped cream though!"

It‚Äôs a nice cafe and the people there are nice but way over priced and the food did not meet expectations."

This is my favorite cafe, and I wish I lived closer to it to be able to get breakfast from here everyday. The turkey cheddar sandwich is made in homemade Moroccan bread and it is super delicious along with the sauce they use, it is to die for! The service here is phenomenal! I met some of the staff and I mentioned I was also of Moroccan descent and we had such wholesome conversations. It really made me feel like I was back home visiting family! The decor of the place is very intricate and exquisite, from the Moroccan zellige fountain to the Moroccan paintings they have on the walls. 1000/10 would recommend this cafe to anyone in New York and even outside of NY!

coffee and this cute little cafe was right across the street and we stepped in to grab a cup of coffee. Once we stepped into this cafe it was like in a cozy place away from the bustling streets of new york, quiet and peaceful. The setting of cafe was so warm
and welcoming. There were people , it was busy yet we could find the calmness. We just ordered a cup of cafe mocha, which was a good one, I enjoyed it , however it could have been a bit stronger in the coffee flavor.
People were ordering different sorts of salads , sandwiches and so on which did really looked great. As we have already reservations made at a brunch place, we had to skip this time.
I would highly recommend this cafe for someone who would enjoy a nice , quiet , alone time with good food options.
The name of the cafe makes total justice, pausecafe, its like literally can take a pause from your life, the vibe of this place makes it possible to pause and relax for a while from

I have the video example as well that we can show, the french fries were so hard and inedible and the chicken poppers remind me of the popcorn chicken I got back in High School.

We were fine waiting especially since it was1:30 PM and we know some businesses are busy but y'all really got to check the temperature of your fryers. At least be careful serving that to someone if you're advertising it in your front board of the store.

Overall store was very nice, the person taking our order was respectful and I liked the addition of the tv right in front of you when sitting. Just didn't like the food experience! At the end of the day its a Tea House."

Initially we wanted them to come on site at our NYC office location at make fresh bubble tea as people came into the office, which they do offer, but the building had a lot of specific requests which made it difficult to coordinate. We ended up deciding to switch to a delivery of 100 bubble teas in the morning for my event that same afternoon. From start to finish, they were very easy to work with and responsive. I stopped by the shop and Justin worked with me to decide on what would be best for delivery and what flavors would be good options. I even requested they add my company‚Äôs stickers to the cups along with their own and they did. Delivery was a little tough (but that was due to the location of the office in midtown, police officers not allowing vehicles to stop, etc.) but we eventually found each other for delivery and they helped bring the bubble teas into the building within the delivery time discussed.

As for the bubble teas during the event, we decided on 50 white peach rose with strawberry popping boba and 50 passion fruit with mango popping boba. They were a HUGE  hit and mostly gone within the hour from the start of the event which we didn‚Äôt expect. We were anticipating some leftovers by the end of the day, but in the end, there were none.

Pricing was reasonable and comparable to other quotes that we received. Brian was great to work with. We would look to work with them again in the future!"

You have to take your shoes off and sit on the floor and enjoy tea the traditional way. The menu offered extensive Chinese tea offerings so we had a lot to choose from. We ended up choosing jasmine and purple robe and we were happy with both choices. It is quite expensive (85$ for 2) but you go for the vibes and experience.

I also enjoyed chatting with Vivian. She pays a lot of attention to each guest, welcoming them into the tea room. So it felt like visiting a cozy home.

The cool part was we had the place to ourselves, as no one else had reserved lunch at the same time. The waiter was also really nice.

The drinks (we had an infused tea, and a sake drink) were great. I‚Äôd give them a 10/10.

The food (we had the beet/cashew soup, hijiki, salmon app, beef app, shrimp app) were mostly good. The odd part was the beef and shrimp apps had a tomato sauce on them, which didn‚Äôt really work. Not bad, but just would not reorder those.

Portions were much larger than as shown in the menu. We left really full. I would definitely go back to try other options on the menu.

Overall, a special place worth trying out, especially for a special occasion (or to grab a great drink in the neighborhood)."

I came here last year as well and had the same beautiful experience. The host and chef are so beyond kind and talented, and the wait is WELL worth it as they take the time to make every dish and beverage as fresh as possible.

Between Hot tea, coffee, craft sake, and amazingly arranged + healthy dishes (with BIG portions might I add!), I can't recommend supporting this little business enough."

Both loose-leaf and prepared for you. Employees are so kind and helpful.

The Lavender Earl Grey was excellent both hot and cold, and I hope I can come back one day to buy some of their Black Rose tea. Their tea wall is so lovely and organized, and they have a small selection of tabletop games for customers to play while enjoying a pot of tea.
Relaxing music, lighting was not too harsh, very cute egg timers.
They were sweet to a couple kids who came in and asked about the tea, and were patient in explaining the teas to them.
Overall, very nice and relaxing experience. Definitely rejuvenates you for a busy afternoon or a hectic evening!"

The emphasis of this place is tea, but not so much on what you can drink at the location but what you can buy and take home.
Food wise, I went around 1:30 PM and had the quiche and their version of the McMuffin which seemed to be vegan. It tastes ok, the only issue is that it felt that it took too much time to warm up the dishes.
Seating wise there is a table and a sofa, so it could get complicated if there was a crowd.
They also had a few table games so you can spend time playing Chess, Jenga or some card games."

A place where only the name resembles what a tea house should be.
The food has nothing to do with a tea house. There's not even tea service!
I ordered a trio of mini desserts and what I got was a joke. A ""fruit tart"" filled with whipped cream and a few sad slices of fruits, an eclair that tasted like it had been in a refrigerator for days and it was also filled with whipped cream...
In what world is an eclair filled with whipped cream and not even glazed, but only drizzled with Hershey's syrup? Who is the Chef behind this disaster of a menu?
The mille crepe cakes looked fantastic, but the filling tasted like whipped butter with very little flavor.
The waitstaff was very polite yet not well trained. They need to be told a fork and a knife is what a person needs to eat a salad.
The only bathroom had a toilet that did not flush...
I really don't get what the hype about this place is all about."

While we were there for lunch on a Sunday, it got very loud to the point of barely hearing each other. We took our dessert to go because of that, but otherwise was a good lunch spot."

We had about 60 guests and booked the entire space for our private event. The price was also reasonable compared to other places for booking the entire space.

I settled with  the Green Tea Mille Crepes Cake and a pot of jasmine tea. Cake had a gently sweetness to it and pairing it with the tea really balances it out.
On top of that, very calming and nice atmosphere to the place.

Only problem I have is the tea is ordered in pots which really bumps up the price ($9 for a pot) if you‚Äôre not in a group."

The food served was very mediocre, for $80 I would expect something a bit more special, not rice with sliced cucumbers, rice with a little smoked salmon, and rice with a small piece of fried eel. The desserts were also ok, again, for the price id expect a bit more, at least something aesthetically pleasing. The ambience of the tea room itself wasn‚Äôt very nice, the lighting is a bit aggressive and just not very comfortable and inviting. All in all, I think there are a lot of nicer afternoon tea places and this one can be skipped."

The wooden tables and tatami benches enhance the experience, making dessert even more enjoyable. I tried the Matcha Kakigori, a Japanese shaved ice dessert, and it was incredibly delicious. The entire crew was absolutely nice and informative about the ingredients and the details of Cha-an. It's the perfect place to visit this summer!"

the meal came out in three course with the first being focused on savory, and the other 2 focused on sweet. the desserts were not too sweet and was the perfect amount just to snack on something mid-afternoon!

She is beyond disrespectful and degrading to not only her employees but her customers. She screams in her employees faces, berates them in front of customers. There‚Äôs plenty more I could mention about her maltreatment towards her workers. Shes only nice when she wants something. Her treatment of her customers includes: banging the phone in their face, telling the customers to leave if they don‚Äôt have intentions to buy anything (after they JUST walked through the door, when they clearly came in with the intent to purchase). This woman loses so much business because of her terrible attitude and doesn‚Äôt take the time out to realize how great she could be if she would pay waaayy more attention to not only improving her customer service, but working on her people skills in general. She treats them like they shouldn‚Äôt even be in there so maybe we should all take our business elsewhere. How can you profess to be a healer with so much hate and animosity in your heart towards the people you mutually benefit from?"

The Afternoon Tea for One set was a journey through exquisite flavors, starting with an array of finger sandwiches of each one tasty and well-prepared, from the truffle egg salad to the smoked salmon with scallion cream cheese. And the Granola Greek Yogurt, which was refreshing and filled with a great mix of textures.

The highlight for me was the Purple Yam Souffl√©, served with red bean ice cream. It was uniquely flavorful, perfectly fluffy, and not too sweet, definitely a must-try! I also enjoyed the Boba Affogato, a creative twist on the classic affogato.

The Tie Guan Yin Oolong Tea paired beautifully with the meal, enhancing the overall experience with its soothing aroma and taste. Highly recommend Prince Tea House for anyone looking for a sophisticated yet comforting tea experience."

Even though we got the wrong order of fries the waiter was super nice and switched it. The wait time for food was quite long, around 20 minutes even though the shop wasn't that busy. At least the twister fries were super good, crunchy on the outside but soft and fluffy on the insideüçüüòç

ü•™The salmon SLT was pretty good but they could've put more cream cheese and more filling because it was kinda dry. The salad on the side was nice but there wasn't enough dressing so some greens were dry. The salmon itself tastes fresh and had a good flavor and overall good presentation üëç

üç≥üê£ The eggs benedict was alright,  the salmon became cooked since it was left out too long. But their poached eggs were sooo good, perfectly cooked with a runny yolk and very creamy which acts as the perfect sauce for the bread and greens."

A golden cup of tea:

I sat on a wooden chair
And suddenly, the world opened up in front of an invisible door
The intoxicating, unforgettable, irreplaceable aroma of tea kissed my lips
I drowned
I became intoxicated
I came back to myself
Another sip
Another sip
And once more
I opened my eyes, and the intoxicating aroma took hold of me again
A piece of my soul, like a small fluid drop,
fell into the teacup
And every sip of tea drew a small part of my soul inside
I was sitting on a small wooden chair
Facing a door that opened to eternity
And the golden teacup danced in my hands

Oh, my dream lover,
I draw you in
As you draw me in

And this thirst for unity
Comes from the scent of your yesterday, from the scent of your today, and from the scent of a thousand years ago

I am still sitting on a small wooden chair
In the middle of 25th Street
Where an invisible door opens
And the scent of happiness draws you into a golden cup of tea.

She has been in her New York tea shop for around 7 years, I believe.

We had the gan pu‚Äôerh, which is a fermented ripe (shou) pu‚Äôerh that is aged inside a small tangerine. It was lovely!

My personal favorite is the Earl Grey Oolong tea ‚Äì it's always brewed to perfection and has the most delightful aroma. The food menu is equally delightful, with a range of delicious desserts and light bites that complement the teas perfectly. The fried snacks here always make me happy; they're crispy, flavorful, and absolutely addictive.

The staff at Prince Tea House are always welcoming and attentive, adding to the overall pleasant experience. The attention to detail in both the decor and the presentation of food and drinks makes every visit feel special.

The food: I only had the highly recommended Molten Lava Cake and the Cucumber Cooler. The cake was warm and moist; it was not overly sweet, just the right amount of chocolate. The Cucumber Cooler (under the cocktails menu) was light and refreshing - it has a light fizz and a refreshing minty taste.

Overall, everything was great and I‚Äôm looking forward to visiting again!"

Aside from the beautifully decorated interior, the desserts and tea selection (as well as other food options) have been absolutely fantastic during each of my visits in the area.

I've caught up with friends who were in town, stopped by for just tea or even just a dessert and each visit has been a wonderful experience.

Just FYI if you ever get the trio option for desserts (I forget the actual menu item name), size wise it is a LOT smaller than you think - as they truly mean BITE sized. üòÖ"

They have managed to put a piano in that small store though it‚Äôs covered and menus are put on top of it. The store is little messy. But despite all that they make decent drinks. Got a mango hand lit lemon fruit tea. It had the jest of lemon, couldn‚Äôt taste mango as much. But I liked the drink in general. Service is pretty fast, got the drinks in few minutes."

Quite a bit of room inside. Bench to sit on along the left side as you enter. There's a small Bistro table with chairs at the counter. Then, there's a counter with two seats at the window. There's a piano that takes up some space. It's covered and there's signs asking not to put anything on top. They had laminated copies of the menu.

We went with simple so we got the Jasmine Green Tea and hot Cheese Green Tea. Both were great. The tea flavor was strong. Next time, will have to try other things on the menu. There's a lot more fruity drinks!"

Ordered a red dragon fruit crystal bubble fruit yakult and mango pomelo. It was not cheap - came out to around $17 for two drinks! It looks like a popular spot because there was always a line. The wait for the drinks took about 5-10 minutes on average on a Sunday evening.

Interesting thing is they sell a ‚Äúbucket‚Äù of tea."

Not much seating space as well. Nevertheless the staff were very friendly and nice."

We enjoyed an iced jasmine green milk tea in their window bar seating and people watched. The tea they use is floral and flavorful. The boba had a great chewiness and capped off a restful stop on our walk around town."
New York,tea house,High Societea Tea Room,ChIJ___z0M0Dw4kR-F8mIKo6jdk,"20 Old Newark Pompton Turnpike, Wayne",4.5,Jason,"High SocieTea gives that perfect vintage tea house feel while also being able to maintain a clean environment. The place is very organic and you can tell it has a lot of passion put into it. That combined with the price and quality that you receive is a really good experience. FYI, it is more English tea than it is asian style.

I did the Queen's tea set ($37 per person) that came with tea, scones, savory and sweet. Benefit is that you can do a junior set and every single section is additive! There is a HUGE selection of teas. I highly recommend booking and checking their website as their whole menu is there. Scones are really delicious. The entire set is actually quite filling. You leave satisfied for sure.

Service is great as they were happy to serve and provide ample explanations regarding the menu itself. The serving of tea can be steadier but the passion they have cannot be replicated! It is a heavy pot of tea Afterall.

Main selling points are the experience and right now it's a semi-witch english tea environment which is great for the season! I say it is absolutely worth $37 dollars if you like the tea environment! Probably one of the best in North Jersey."

The setup of the room was decorated so beautifully with flowers and the front couch area was the perfect photo location.

I‚Äôve been wanting to try getting into specialty tea and was excited to check out the store. Immediately was met with rude and unhelpful staff. The answers I got were short and condescending and killed any interest I had in starting my tea journey at this shop in particular. The friends that I was with were also scolded for taking picture despite no signs or indication that wasn‚Äôt allowed. My complaint is directed directly at the older gentleman in the glasses. If you are reading this, respectfully, you should not be working in retail or customer service. The shop was beautiful and had so much going for it otherwise."

The service was slow, and the staff seemed indifferent. The tea tasted bland and overpriced. Additionally, the entire experience felt very stressful, with a tall barista with white hair aggressively hovering around the entrance, coming down every couple of minutes. He made the atmosphere uncomfortable, and when we left without tipping due to the exorbitant $58 cost for just water and some leaves, he demanded to know why we didn't tip in a hostile manner, as if we owed him gratuity for subpar service. Overall, it was a disappointing and uncomfortable experience, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

The owner is very nice and let me stare at the small teapots for over 30 minutes while I tried to decide which one I wanted. I think the feedback about the lack service is completely undeserving based on my own experience. This is not a cafe for working at a laptop and you should respect the space when you go inside because many things are fragile and delicate. I think if you respect the space you will find it very welcoming.

We had an amazing evening at the Orchid Tea Cafe. Upon walking in, it was a busy but calm atmosphere! Definitely unique decor!

Because the space is so small, we called beforehand to make sure there was a table available, and when we came in, she asked if we called and definitely accommodated us!

Even if I am not in the neighborhood, this is a great spot to travel to when I want a nice quiet, cozy place with a Amazing Food and great service to meet up with a friend or go out on a date

HOW WAS THE FOOD?

We got a special black tea, a hot coffee boba, the volcano mussels, the cucumber salad, and the seafood spaghetti

Volcano Mussels and Spicy cucumber salad (wasn‚Äôt that spicy- but I believe you can adjust spiciness) both were a 10 out of 10

My friend had the spaghetti seafood pasta. She would probably say it was a 7.5/10.

They ran out of tapioca bubbles, so we were not able to try them.

WAS THE SERVICE GOOD?

I believe we were helped by the owner of the shop? We met her son and immediately felt right at home. It was like she welcomed us right in. Even though they were consistently receiving orders, she was still very attentive and answered all of our questions

WILL WE COME BACK?

When I am in the neighborhood, I will 100% be returning back - #1 for the service #2 for the flavor of food ( am a big flavor snob) and #3 for the atmosphere"

They have a couple new bubble tea flavors: Logan Date Milk tea and Rose Milk tea. I tried Logan Date because I never had it anywhere else! Still tastes like milk tea but has chopped up dates (already included in the syrup I believe) which is nice but the skin bits and seeds might throw you off. I‚Äôll try rose milk next time!!
As for payment, they do accept card at a minimum of $10. Just pay cash to avoid the electronic serve fee :)"

Edit: came by again and tasted the popcorn chicken, it was so good and so nicely seasoned. Definitely will get it again. The owner is so friendly, I‚Äôll make sure to always keep her in business. We were waiting outside my car for the food because there was no parking and I told her she didn‚Äôt have to come out as I will put a timer on my phone to come in and pick up the food.

Menu has options ranged across its tea selections, decided on the original one and it was good.

Not watered down tea, better to try in person because it's more of the authentic tea taste than what we recognized from drinking from the can.

When you wait for your drink to be prepared, you can read about the Wang Lao Ji Herbal Tea's history. There are a couple of standing tables if you want to hang around too.

Parking is busy around this area, either find a parking garage or take public transportation to safe yourself from traffic. All major credit cards or cash is accepted. Staff is friendly."

2. The Monkfruit Chrysanthemum tea is very slightly sweet and has a very distinct monkfruit taste.
3. The service was very fast and as you wait you can explore the museum.
4. Everything was clean and not crowded."
New York,tea house,Lady Mendl's Tea Salon,ChIJFQa-2KFZwokRE89uuDTQsdE,"56 Irving Pl, New York",4.4,Quasar,"Nothing can beat the luxurious surroundings, the attention to detail and the friendly service. The sandwiches on the day we went tasted all the same with a heavy leaning on the sweet side. I would have liked some contrast in flavor, like something with a tapenade, or a hint of mustard or pickles to keep the palate alert. But no the uniformly honeyed flavor all around.
The scones were great, and so was the sponge lemony cake, and chocolate covered fruit. But it felt like a sugar overload.
The tea was light in flavor and I would recommend sticking to one flavor, rather than a pairing with each different plate.
Overall it was an oasis of calm and relaxation from the hustle bustle of the city."

The moment I entered the door, I fell in love with how cozy, artsy, and classy this tea salon is! We ordered the Afternoon Tea service, which is definitely worth it, especially if you love tea like me. With the afternoon tea service, you can have, I think, 4-6 different kinds of tea paired with soup, sandwiches, scones, and some sweet treats at the end. I highly recommend it if you want to experience the whole afternoon tea experience. My favorite tea is the Moroccan Mint Green! The traditional scones with Devonshire clotted cream are the best.

We had a wonderful experience here. Their service is really good. Since we chose the Grand Heights service, they reached out to us beforehand to ask us for our tea selections so our tea would be ready to serve when we arrive. They have provisions for vegetarians which is a big plus point for me.

They have a good selection of teas. The sandwiches, scones and desserts were nice. I really liked the fact that the soup was not heavy. That allowed us to enjoy the rest of the food without feeling too full from the soup itself.

My only issue would be that it gets hot in the place. At the end of our meal, as I was walking towards the counter to pay, I noticed that some of the other tables were provided with table fans. Ours didn‚Äôt have one. I would have brought it up if I had noticed it earlier.

Overall, definitely recommended!"

My wife and I got the grand heights because we wanted to try multiple teas - and it was well worth it as it! We enjoyed 5 total different teas.

The soup and crumpet were delicious, I loved the sandwiches and my wife loved the scone and clotted cream. We were so stuffed and hydrated we took the desserts to go.

They had ipad ordering kiosks which I liked because we can look at the drink pictures and ingredient lists before choosing. It was empty when we came on a Monday late afternoon so the drinks came out right away.

Pink Ombre Slush ($7.50): The pink ombre is a slush made from jasmine green tea with fresh lychee, aloe, dragon fruit, and cheese foam. I got 70% sweet which was recommended and the perfect sweetness level for me. This was so refreshing and tasty! I love the aloe bits as well."

I hadn't stop by in a while and they have made some significant improvements. They have the machines set up so you can place your order and they have seemed to level up their drinks. I went for the brown sugar boba and it was so good. My only thought is that they don't ask for the sugar level on the machine (I usually prefer 50% sugar) but it didn't bother me much. I'm excited to try their new flavor offerings and managed to get a friend hooked as well. They are very quick and efficient with their orders too.

I stumbled onto it because now and then I look for new bubble tea spots wherever I wander, and finally was able to check it out.

They have a minimal menu currently that‚Äôs mostly drinks and with a few desserts. This isn‚Äôt a bad thing at all because some bubble tea spots have such a large menu it may as well be impossible to pick!

I like how they have a few flavors that aren‚Äôt as typical, especially their Hokkaido and Okinawa milk teas.

For anyone more sensitive to sweetness of bubble teas nowadays, note that you might want to get zero sugar, especially if you‚Äôre ordering tapioca (boba) in your drink.

I also enjoy the atmosphere as a spot to get work done. Parking is plentiful on street or the big municipal parking garage around the corner. Also their BATHROOM has a sliding door which I‚Äôve already seen people get confused by üòÇ but whose design is cool.

Hoping they do well and grow! And maybe add some real taro and related products which I‚Äôm finding I enjoy more lately."

Highly highly recommend!"
New York,tea house,T√© Company,ChIJ02UqP5RZwokR94y_zTN85qY,"163 W 10th St, New York",4.8,Forum Shah,"This spot is clearly a local spot where many people come to get a nice come of well brewed tea and enjoy some me time. So many people came in with a book and enjoyed brewed tea from beautiful tea-ware.

We came here for a tea tasting as a surprise present for my husband. We unfortunately weren‚Äôt able to book the Introduction to Taiwanese Teas experience as they were sold out. I had called Elena and she had said she would add us to the waitlist in case there was a cancellation. Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, no one cancelled. Since I really wanted to plan something Elena suggested we come in around 11am and that they would try to give some information about the teas as we did our tea tasting from their regular menu.

Ambiance: It‚Äôs a super cute and quaint location. They have this nice big window in the front that gives classic NYC small shop vibes. The location at max fits 13-15 people but that adds to the quaintest of it all. They have a gorgeous display of treats and teas which enhances the feel of a small tea shop.  I love the vibe here and would easily come back with a book to enjoy the teas, pastries, and ambiance.

Tea tasting experience was wonderful. We let Garret pick the teas we would taste and just let him know that my husband is a big fan of oolong teas. He picked three wonderful teas and spent a lot of time telling us about the history of Taiwanese teas and the growing, collection, and drying process. Garret knew so much about the teas and answered so many of our questions. It was so enlightening to realize how much time and effort goes into making these teas. We tried the Mt Pyrus, Oriental Beauty, and Frozen Summit  teas. My favorites were the Mt Pyrus tea and charcoal roasted Frozen Summit. I‚Äôve never had a charcoal roasted tea before and I loved the flavor profile. It was so unique and smooth.

Snacks: We got the shortbread, pineapple cake, and button trio. They were exactly as I imagine they should taste. Crumbly and buttery with the right amount of sugar. They complemented the teas really well.

Price: The tea tasting and snacks were very reasonably priced. Between the 2 of us we spent less than $30 per person which is amazing considering they refilled our tea pots 3 times and we were there for over 2 hours.

We had such a wonderful experience here and will be coming back all the time.

Thank you Elena and Garret for making this such a memorable experience.

The ambience, the delicacy, and the meticulous care of the waiters and owner all contributed to a remarkable experience. The service, the colors, the teas, and the decor combined to create a setting that felt both inviting and serene. After three bustling days in New York, this sanctuary provided the warm, tranquil respite I needed. Sipping the tea was truly therapeutic.

I loved that this shop was conveniently located downstairs, part of the building block‚Äîa unique feature I haven‚Äôt encountered elsewhere. It felt like I was transported to an exquisite, off-the-beaten-path tea haven. The subtlety of the place grew on me, leaving me with a lingering sense of enjoyment. Much like a fine wine‚Äîthough I‚Äôm not a wine drinker‚Äîthis tea experience has become a cherished memory that has only deepened with time."

The quality of ingredients tastes fresh and well-proportioned. They take their time when making your drink, and will even have you take a ""shot"" of your drink midway through the preparation process to ensure that you're satisfied with the sweetness and flavor. The shop is beautifully decorated as well.

The major downside is how long you have to wait for service. They only allow one person/group in at a time, which means you have to stand/sit outside if there's someone inside. I've had to wait up to 30 minutes before. There is one bench, and no other outdoor or indoor seating."

Harney & Sons Soho is such a fun and beautiful tea boutique. I love the whole aesthetics of the store and the fact that they have a tea tasting counter and a separate tea/coffee shop on the back of the store. In addition to teas, the store also offers a nice selection of desserts and afternoon tea sets for you to dine in.

My favorite Harney & Sons tea collection of all time is their city tea. They‚Äôre so cute and tastes so good - makes a great souvenirs. I usually get the New York City Tea, Soho Tea, or the MET Tea.

The store also sells a small collection of tea pots, tea cups and some homeward including city candles. Loving this tea shop and all their services."

No sugar and a little bit of ice, no problem! They have options that aren‚Äôt available at other places, brew the teas in house instead of using mixes, and have some dairy alternative (and lactose free) milk options. The staff were friendly and helpful. You also have the option to order from a kiosk or a person :) It‚Äôs more of a grab and go place than a sit down and chill one, but that‚Äôs exactly what I needed.

It was quite different from all the boba shops that we have here in LA but overall still enjoyed the drink I tried. What seemed suspicious to me was the Oats Latte but it turned out to be a very good drink. By the time I took my Uber back to my hotel, I wanted to go back and get another one or two for my flight for the very next day. I'll definitely come back and get more next time I'm visiting."

The staff knew every thing and was ready to answer every dumb question we had. We asked a ton and they were happy to answer every one of them. I originally found the prices outrageous but I enjoyed the experience. Coming with a group of four would likely be best since you could cut down on the price of sharing a nice tea tasting. I posted photos from our tea sampling of three curated teas chosen by the staff seasonally.  They come back to fill your tea pots multiple times throughout so you feel like you get what you paid for in the end.
The prices are really shocking at first glance. They do traditional Chinese tea, not herbal tea or English breakfast (so if you come here for Jasmine tea or something this you will be disappointed)

Regarding the bad reviews; I went around and touched stuff around and the staff was fine with it. Maybe they've hired new more relaxed staff."

Some notes though: no bathroom, limited samples to 3 options although the first 2 I didn't specifically ask for, no published tasting notes so you have to guess at the flavor profiles for a long list of flavors."

It was over $70/person, not that you could look it up and check the menu ahead of time.  In fact the only menu is the tea menu and the treat tower is just what you get (dietary restricted folks are just SOL).

But don‚Äôt come hungry because it isn‚Äôt a lot of food. The macrons were definitely from Trader Joe‚Äôs and the cupcakes were from a grocery store.

There were only two people working and one of them was yelling at the other when we got in. We were seated for at least 30 minutes before our tea was brought over and even longer for the food (which remember, we didn‚Äôt have to order, so the selection is predetermined).

So we waited a very long time, for small amount of mediocre food, and had to pay over $200 for three people."

That could be better. It‚Äôs all ready for interior & design. Very pretty. However, the bread wasn't great at all. I expected something different level of Parisian style bakery. But it was not:/
Owner reply was sucks. Whatever. Good luck.

Reply for Owner -
and I picked up the latte and Madeline.
If you think ppl not a customer who only buys one croissant, there‚Äôs nothing, then I can‚Äôt say anything to you.  Honestly, your server wasn‚Äôt very friendly and it wasn‚Äôt nice.
Other than your store, there are a tons of places in Manhattan that sell incredibly delicious croissants w/ excellent service. Look at your price, taste honestly and your reply.
And go to right next shop ask your self.

Your shop is not much worthy to use money. Service, taste, price and your reply.
None of worthy.

Even after hearing this, no one wouldn‚Äôt go to your store and eat croissants and spend money. If you think it's funny to sell only one croissant, ask yourself if you're serious about your business. Good luck~"

Cons: This place is so tiny, and when I say tiny, I mean it can only fit 10-12 people in total. The tables are so tiny that they could not fit our plates. The portions are insanely small compared to the price. And last but not least, the prices are really insane. We did the classic tea for two and each one of us paid $90 (with 15% tip). To add to that, there was only one waitress for the whole place and service was somewhat slow and she was a little rude (she literally stood in front of me waiting for me to write down the tip and didn‚Äôt leave the table side). In conclusion, I highly would not recommend you come to this place, it‚Äôs tiny, and extremely expensive compared to below average experience you get and the tiny portion of food they give you.

First of all, i walked in the cafe and there was no one sitting, hence there was no reservation list whatsoever! The pictures that i posted is in your place! If you need more information that i was there, you can contact me directly instead of denying your customers and this is all because i said the truth about your place."

Overall, it feels like it‚Äôs dirty. The burrito was properly not good. I had one bite and I was too grossed out to have another. Positive: the buttermilk scone was very good and so was the Alice Tea Blend. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs not enough to make me go back there. Maybe to pickup a scone? Oh and it was insanely expensive for this type of place. I spent $55 for a burrito, scone and tea‚Ä¶"

We liked the Stardust and Rooibos Bourbon herbal teas we ordered. They have unique flavors that aren‚Äôt weak like most teas. The scones at this place are fantastic! We loved the Strawberry Raspberry scone and the Buttermilk Scone with jam and preserves. Definitely recommend the Ham & Gruy√®re sandwiches as well.

It‚Äôs located in a nice area in the ues. I will say the decor wasn‚Äôt out of this world enchanting, and felt a little outdated. But I appreciate the Alice in Wonderland details all around.

We ordered the Madhatter which was more than enough for two people. If you don‚Äôt have much of a sweet tooth this may not be the ideal option as it was a lot but so amazing! The pastries may have been a bit dry but it still tasted good."

refreshing but mild grassy flavour. Fairly one dimensional tasting with not a lot of sweetness or umami, more boiled vegetal flavours. Tea started separating very quickly, I don't think I saw them sift it so it was a tad powdery. Pretty expensive for what you get as there's a good amount of ice.

Gyokuro iced tea was delicious and highlighted the tea flavour extremely well."

But the toast (we asked for two extra portions so we can have with the eggs) was $12. Ridiculous price! The setting of the tables (old wood) kinda awkward. I could barely hear my partner on the other side of the table. Also very awkward to eat one bowl of granola in two. And the waiters/waitresses in jeans and leather jacket kinda take you out of the ambiance that I thought this place is supposed to have.

The matcha koicha affogato with a shot of sweet potato shochu was delicious. The matcha itself was thick and had a delicate taste and was complimented well by the gelato.

Would definitely come back and hope I get the same server!"

We ordered an iced matchappucino, but it was so watery that we couldn't appreciate any matcha flavor. The matcha wasn't whisked properly, leaving grains in our drink. We also tried a regular matcha affogato, which was much tastier since the matcha wasn't diluted. Overall, this place is overhyped and I definitely make better matchas than this :()"
New York,tea house,Setsugekka East Village,ChIJF1mkwpxZwokRLSwkdI11UfQ,"74 E 7th St, New York",4.5,Aku Yamine,"Cutest matcha shop I have ever been to. I have been trying to become more knowledgeable about matcha and its flavor profiles. Typically, whenever I go to a place that serves matcha, it never tastes very good with a sharp bitterness remaining after you drink it. However, this place was such a wonderful experience. The location is a bit small, which is probably why it is a take out cafe, but there were patrons that sat around the tatami(?) area. When you sit, you are greeted by a worker who explains the matcha that they are offering. When I visited, they had the Yamenohana matcha, which was explained to be fully bodied with chocolate-ly undertones, the House Matcha, which was stronger with purple yam flavors and the Seiho, which was light. The menu changes depending on what they had available, and the coolest part for me was that they tell show you in the menu where each matcha comes from in Japan. You can get your matcha in a variety of different ways, including cold/hot, straight or with milk, and as an affogato. I went with the workers' recommendation of an iced Yamenohana matcha. It was so good. The color was such a vibrant green, and there were no strong bitter tones. The flavor was so well balanced but yet matcha strong in a good way. I have a friend who is not the biggest matcha fan, and she said it was very good, and she liked even as an individual who doesn't like the flavor a lot.  I loved it so much that I asked if I could purchase some, and they do sell some of the matcha either in a 20 g container or 40g. Both of the workers were so sweet that I wish I could shout them out on here. When I come back to New York, I will definitely visit again to try a new matchs possibly purchase more powder. Thank you for the experience and the great matcha üçµ"

They make the matcha in front of you but once they‚Äôre done making your drink they will ask you to move away from the bar. The cups are in togo cups so you can leave anytime. To me, this doesn‚Äôt give off a very relaxing atmosphere. But maybe that‚Äôs not their goal here. The matcha is ok as well, nice color and not too bitter."
New York,tea house,Setsugekka East Village,ChIJF1mkwpxZwokRLSwkdI11UfQ,"74 E 7th St, New York",4.5,Christina Huynh,Very watery matcha with a hefty price tag. The space inside was very suffocating. They put on a show by scooping a generous amount of matcha just to dilute it with so much water. The whisking was also half-hearted. My matchappuchino had only milk foam and no milk. My friend got the matcha latte and also thought it was flavorless.

They offer classes on matcha preparation and tasting, and their store is equipped with air conditioning to ensure a comfortable environment. The matcha is freshly ground, which is evident from the presence of a matcha grinder, a rarity in the United States. While the matcha I purchased was slightly strong for my preference, as I prefer a sweeter taste, I highly recommend this establishment to matcha enthusiasts.

I've seen reviews saying their soft serve is miles better than their drinks. Their matcha powder is indeed premium, yet the quality of their tea lattes in-store is inconsistent. Glad that the limited-time hojicha soft serve is truly legit.

If you are a tea addict or matcha/hojicha enthusiast, this soft serve won't let you down. It's very rich in hojicha flavor and the soba crunch adds depth to the texture.

$7 after tax for quality hojicha is totally fine to me. The portion looks small in photos and vids but the actual size is slightly bigger. My only complaint is the hollow center of the soft serve lol. They only fill the edges and leave a hole which kinda put me off."

Highly highly recommend this for first date.

Friday night 6:15 reservation

Definitely make a reservation
However many people walked in without one It's a small place so there's limited seating.

We were sat in the corner perfect and cozy quiet enough and busy enough to be able to hear each other and still feel the energy of the room.

We were so busy talking that we turned away the waitress two times. Loved her accent Irish I believe I'm 99% sure she had this wonderful Irish accent.

My date had tuna salad sandwich
Was delicious and homemade like your mom made it for you or someone from The past where you just love it like comfort in your mouth delicious.

I had the homemade soup same thing felt like my mom made this right for me I had bread toast with it delicious multigrain

Iced tea of the day which is highly recommended was like a raspberry or a berry tea it was great I would come back just to have this.

You can't just have tea you have to order something that's the rules.

After we were done we had Earl Gray in this was my favorite moment. With the real teacups and the real strainer and all of the fun that English tea is that I grew up with

We had the scones and jam and cream and that is definitely something you should have if you want to come here Just for tea and want to order something that you have to get this scones they are just so much fun You feel like you're in a different country here in the middle of New York City.

We close the place.
The staff sat behind us and bringing out with some other friends with various accents English Scottish I couldn't play some of the other ones but it was just us in the corner and then behind us having a jolly old good time.

They put up the chairs on the tables lock the door and we all just kind of hung out We were not bothered by them They never asked us to leave I felt like I was in someone's home I got up use the restroom which is the tiniest restroom ever so quaint

We said thank you so much to them Thank you for your hospitality.

Highly recommend"

The tea selection is exceptional, catering to both connoisseurs and casual drinkers. I tried the house blend Earl Grey. They also have traditional British Teas like Barry‚Äôs and Yorkshire Gold. It's the perfect spot to slow down, savor the moment, and indulge in a cup of tea or a hearty meal. They offer traditional and vegetarian options of old English favorites, Sunday Roast, Shepard‚Äôs Pie and the fish and chips looked well done. They of course offer the British condiments to go along with the meal.

For me, adding to the allure Tea and Sympathy offers vegan soups that are both flavorful and comforting. I tried the butternut squash soup which was a generous portion and delightful. Their ""Absolutely Fabulous"" salad truly lives up to its name, delivering a fresh and hearty salad experience.

The standout feature, however, is their impeccable service. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and always ready to assist, enhancing the overall experience.

There is also a shoppe with British snack and tea favorites."

While our timing was a little off (we had to wait about fifteen minutes and then went half an hour later than originally scheduled) every other detail was amazing.

Teresa asked about our tea preferences and experiences and curated an individual tea tasting experience, full of interesting history and information. The place is small ‚Äì there was one other group when we started and another which walked in right before we left, but had the place to ourselves for most of the experience.

We tried Taiwanese, Chinese, and Korean teas, which were each steeped four different times.

We really enjoyed the scones and tea sandwiches and desserts- my friend loved the gluten free version and we were able to sit for a few hours and catch up.

We also got to chat with our server Alan who is lovely and the rest of the staff who were so welcoming and we just can‚Äôt wait until our next stop in!

I highly recommend adding this as a stop if you‚Äôre craving a break from the bustling crowds!"

You can‚Äôt make reservations online, but we were able to make reservations over the phone. We came for afternoon tea, and it was a disappointing experience. The sandwiches and cakes were minuscule and didn‚Äôt taste good. At $45.95/person, you‚Äôre not getting what you pay for. You can get significantly more and better food at other tea places in the city for a comparable price. FYI, they won‚Äôt let you swap out the sandwiches, so if you‚Äôre not a salmon fan for example, you‚Äôre stuck with the salmon sandwiches. The only redeeming quality about this place is that the location is cute. However, the A/C either wasn‚Äôt on or wasn‚Äôt working the day we were there, and the heat was stifling."
New York,tea house,Kings' Carriage House,ChIJc8woqr5YwokR4juQPWnewxw,"251 E 82nd St, New York",4,Gloria Ghita,"Service and atmosphere is 5 star but food is more like 3. You basically pay for the beautiful decor (Victorian like) and the right to sit there and sip tea. The food was too sugary and wish it had more substantial savory options. The salmon pieces and the little tarts on the top were great, but the bread of the cucumber sandwiches was incredibly dry (tasted stale) so didn‚Äôt love those. If the food was better, I would definitely come back but for now, think it‚Äôs a one time visit for the experience."

The beautifully decorated interiors and inviting ambiance set the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.

My friends and I opted for the exquisite afternoon tea experience, and it was nothing short of extraordinary. We savored a delightful assortment of savory sandwiches, freshly baked scones, and delectable sweets, each morsel bursting with flavor and artfully presented. The addition of an entr√©e made our afternoon tea both satisfying and indulgent.

Our server was good, ensuring that we had everything we needed to make our visit truly memorable. From the exceptional cuisine to the warm and inviting atmosphere, every aspect of our time at Kings' Carriage House was nothing short of perfection.

Kings' Carriage House is a hidden gem in the heart of the Upper East Side that offers a one-of-a-kind experience. Whether you're looking to indulge in a delightful afternoon tea or enjoy a sumptuous dinner, this enchanting establishment promises to leave you with cherished memories and a longing to return."
New York,tea house,Kings' Carriage House,ChIJc8woqr5YwokR4juQPWnewxw,"251 E 82nd St, New York",4,S P,"Visited here on a girls trip and we were not disappointed! We chose the Afternoon Tea option and a later time closer to closing. It's pretty straightforward as to service. We had pre-selected our time online and they do give grace if you're running a few minutes late which is great for traffic reasons. After being seated, the waiter hands you a menu with the two options on it. (Afternoon or High Tea), the difference outside of $10 is you get a ""main dish"" option with High Tea. Once you choose the one you want, your tea is brought out with your ""food"". We found it a nice array of tea sandwiches and desserts and it filled us up to our surprise. We were never rushed to finish quickly and got the experience we came there for. The area you're eating in is a tad cramped if full (which it was when we went), but somehow we still felt like we had our own section to talk amongst ourselves. You may have to maneuver a bit past some people in chairs to get from your table to the bathroom though. Also, I'm not sure if it's very Accessible since I didn't notice an elevator anywhere and again, the dining area is small. There is a private dining area I noticed in the back so they probably do small private parties.  Being candid, I did find the scones a little dry and maybe cooked a little too long, but it wasn't a big enough problem to cause us to not enjoy it. If you're in NYC, and want to try Afternoon Tea, you should give it a try! It's one of the more affordable Tea experiences."

The little spaces where the tables are placed are nice for aesthetic, but really, they‚Äôre a tripping hazard. The table that we sat at was very broken and would wobble if you put a little bit of weight on it, the taro milk tea says that it comes with lychee but it doesnt, and it lacked flavor. The service was fine but it wasnt enough to compensate for everything else, don‚Äôt recommend."

The milk tea Lacked flavor (watery), and there were no bubbles?
My daughter had a hot brown sugar latte, which she said was good.
The guy working there was nice.
Does ""sugar amount "" mean flavor amount? Perhaps that's why mine lacked flavor.? I chose 50%.
If that's the case, they should change the option to ""sugar/flavor"" amount.?"

So before it does, take a trip to the Russian Tea Room. The food is amazing!!!  I‚Äôve been to Russia and it‚Äôs even better here than there. During the Summer months it‚Äôs not busy at all and getting a reservation is easy. In the Fall it‚Äôs very busy and you can visit all four floors. The decor is like stepping into a Time Machine and the vibe is stunning. The service was also that of the past with every need being met by several different servers at every turn. I‚Äôve always wanted to go to this memorable restaurant and I‚Äôm so glad I did. It was worth every penny. We 100% plan to go back for tea during the holidays."
New York,tea house,The Russian Tea Room,ChIJ_816e_dYwokROMvaQpsyemk,"150 W 57th St, New York",3.9,mimi tann,"Over the top opulent d√©cor. The most ostentatiously and lavish dining room my wife and I have ever set foot in. Might want to wear sunglasses to subdue the stunning surroundings (lol). It's fun to take it all in. The booths are fabulously comfortable and best of all, despite the d√©cor, it is a sedate dining experience. My wife and I do not like loud and here the noise level is civilized. Your focus is on the food, not on the table next to you talking nonsense loudly. Staff is outgoing and service is faultless.

Surprisingly, at the time of this review RTR has a 3.9 star rating. It is much better than that, but I think I know the reason. Basically it depends on what time you go. Wife and I have eaten here a few times. The only time we have been disappointed is when there is an event at Carnegie Hall, which is next door, and it feels like the kitchen at RTR is overwhelmed. Get the food out no matter what. The food taste's like an assembly line dish as do the cocktails. Not bad, just mediocre. An example would be the time my wife had Vegetable Wellington, which was a thumbs down. Virtually tasteless. Same for the Sea Bass I had. Not terrible, but considering the price and previous dinners there it was very disappointing.  Super long wait to get seated as well even though we had reservations. Like a 1/2 hour wait. Other patrons were in the same boat. Lots of complaining and RTR was packed. On the positive the noise level was not annoying even though every table was taken and as always the service was impeccable. So the secret is....late lunch or early dinner.

Now the good. Our last dinner was an early one having made reservations for 4:30. A wonderful time and a great meal from start to finish. Not crowded and quite a few tables available. Appetizers where an RTR salad and RTR Borscht. Salad greens were fresh and the maple vinaigrette along with the goat cheese crumbles made for a perfect salad. My wife described the RTR Borscht as good as a friend's home made ( a recipe from ""the old country"" as in Eastern European) Borscht. High praise indeed. A beef pirozhoz was an accompaniment and was noted to be delicious. In the past we have also had Khinkali and Onion soup. Both were very satisfying. Main courses were Cotelette Kiev (chicken) and Potato Vareniki. The chicken was moist and tender with a wonderfully crisp and flavorful skin. The sauce was sublime and added just the right amount of pop to the dish. Fresh vegetables rounded out the dish. Delish and same for the Vareniki. Deserts, Blintzes and Cr√®me Brulee, were very good. Although the Blintzes were satisfying the portion size was extremally disappointing. I'm almost never taken aback by portion size, but good lord two tiny Blintzes that would blow away if you sneezed. Would not order again. They were good, but not like they were the most shockingly good Blintzes that would justify their price. You've been warned. On the flip side definitely order the Banana Nalysnyky. Ten thousand thumbs up on that one."

The food is absolutely incredible, with flavors that are top tier. Their Russian dumplings were a standout, delicious and unlike any other dumpling I've ever tried. While the cuisine was extraordinary, it was the remarkable service from our waiter, the staff, and the manager that made the evening unforgettable for my mother, aunt, grandmother, and me.

The service was incredible and the food was delicious overall (the best pierogis we‚Äôve ever had!) I did find the chicken a little bit dry but otherwise everything was fantastic.

Incredible 'Proper old school New York society' vibe... cosy, ornate interior - a true dining experience. Food was great, as was the wine.

I purchased a $6.50 ginger milk tea, and to my horror only syrup and condensed milk + hot water were used. You would think Ten Ren, who boasts about their tea quality, would use real tea leaves?

There is absolutely NO TEA in this drink. To charge almost $7 for syrup and hot water is absolutely absurd. The profit margin is a highway robbery.

They have a large tea selection, sell ginseng which my grandmother bought. Are friendly to people who aren't Asian and have a cozy little spot to sit and drink the tea.

Like others, I also tried the 913 milk tea, which is popular, with half sugar and no ice. I was really hoping for a strong tea taste, but I was sadly IMMENSELY let down. For $6.50, it's seriously watered down and there is no strong tea impression. Sadly not worth at all. I'd easily suggest Chun Yang over Ten Ren based on my experience. Much more distinct oolong flavor for the same price post-tax.

HOWEVER, I can't speak on the experience of buying loose leaf tea nor the quality of it, and it's been raved upon for its high quality. Staff is nice, and I felt welcomed!!"

After my poor experience at Tea Art, Linda (the store manager) was very quick to respond and resolve the situation. She informed me that she looked into this situation to understand what may have caused this and was apologetic. I went back and the tea was perfectly steeped with a nice depth of flavor. The jasmine jelly added a nice texture to the drink. This time I could definitely tell that there was a topping present. Really appreciate their commitment to ensure customers are left feeling satisfied with their drink and I will definitely be back to try more!!

‚Äî-Original review‚Äî-
UGH, maybe it was an off day but I came in with high hopes after reading these reviews and was left so disappointed. The Formosa jasmine tea with jasmine jelly tasted so diluted and there was barely any tea flavor. It literally felt like I was drinking iced water with the essence of jasmine tea. There was also little to no jasmine jelly present to the point where I was seriously questioning whether it was there in the first place (still unsure if it was)‚Ä¶"

The teas were flavorful and refreshing and we appreciated the assortment of toppings available (the star jellies were CUTE!) but I am pretty sure there is artificial sugar in what I ordered - either the tea or the jellies - and I can‚Äôt stand the artificial sweetener aftertaste so that was disappointing.

But a cafe called The Chai Spot had better deliver on the chai, and this place sadly did not.

The Traditional Cardamom Chai tasted more like liquid shortbread and was missing any spices that I could discern. Cardamom is my favorite spice--trust me, I could pick it out if it were mixed with dog doo. The fact that I couldn't taste any in the Traditional was just sad. The Butter Chai was a bit more flavorful, but still pretty bland. And the Coconut Rose Chai was great for two sips, then way, way too sweet."

[+/-] there is nearly always a line
[-] no plant-based milk alternatives
[-] staff is not always the fastest

I can strongly recommend this place IF you are not in a rush. I have not found the staff unfriendly (like mentioned in some other reviews), but have been asked to come back to pick up my Tiger Milk Tea twice already (after standing in line for approx. 10 mins each time)... so, yeah, bring patience. They seem to have an app, which makes ordering ahead possible (see pictures), so maybe that is an option IG you are in a rush but still want Bubble Tea :)

There are vegan options,  but not for milk teas, as this place does not offer plant-based milk alternatives. Can adjust sugar and ice levels to taste."

Food wise, I went around 1:30 PM and had the quiche and their version of the McMuffin which seemed to be vegan. It tastes ok, the only issue is that it felt that it took too much time to warm up the dishes.
Seating wise there is a table and a sofa, so it could get complicated if there was a crowd.

They take their time when making your drink, and will even have you take a ""shot"" of your drink midway through the preparation process to ensure that you're satisfied with the sweetness and flavor. The shop is beautifully decorated as well.

The major downside is how long you have to wait for service. They only allow one person/group in at a time, which means you have to stand/sit outside if there's someone inside. I've had to wait up to 30 minutes before. There is one bench, and no other outdoor or indoor seating."

After my poor experience at Tea Art, Linda (the store manager) was very quick to respond and resolve the situation. She informed me that she looked into this situation to understand what may have caused this and was apologetic. I went back and the tea was perfectly steeped with a nice depth of flavor. The jasmine jelly added a nice texture to the drink. This time I could definitely tell that there was a topping present. Really appreciate their commitment to ensure customers are left feeling satisfied with their drink and I will definitely be back to try more!!

UGH, maybe it was an off day but I came in with high hopes after reading these reviews and was left so disappointed. The Formosa jasmine tea with jasmine jelly tasted so diluted and there was barely any tea flavor. It literally felt like I was drinking iced water with the essence of jasmine tea. There was also little to no jasmine jelly present to the point where I was seriously questioning whether it was there in the first place (still unsure if it was)‚Ä¶"

The staff were friendly and helpful.

It was quite different from all the boba shops that we have here in LA but overall still enjoyed the drink I tried. What seemed suspicious to me was the Oats Latte but it turned out to be a very good drink.

I would recommend either the chocolate milk tea, Oreo Creme br√ªl√©e milk tea, or the Ginger Milk Tea. Other than quality drinks; the food is great too! However, different locations offer different menus; and some don‚Äôt offer any food at all. I love their Korean Fried Chicken and Bento Boxes.

A place where only the name resembles what a tea house should be.
The food has nothing to do with a tea house. There's not even tea service!
I ordered a trio of mini desserts and what I got was a joke. A ""fruit tart"" filled with whipped cream and a few sad slices of fruits, an eclair that tasted like it had been in a refrigerator for days and it was also filled with whipped cream...
In what world is an eclair filled with whipped cream and not even glazed, but only drizzled with Hershey's syrup? Who is the Chef behind this disaster of a menu?
The mille crepe cakes looked fantastic, but the filling tasted like whipped butter with very little flavor.
The waitstaff was very polite yet not well trained. They need to be told a fork and a knife is what a person needs to eat a salad.
The only bathroom had a toilet that did not flush...
I really don't get what the hype about this place is all about."

We came here for a tea tasting as a surprise present for my husband. We unfortunately weren‚Äôt able to book the Introduction to Taiwanese Teas experience as they were sold out. I had called Elena and she had said she would add us to the waitlist in case there was a cancellation. Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, no one cancelled. Since I really wanted to plan something Elena suggested we come in around 11am and that they would try to give some information about the teas as we did our tea tasting from their regular menu.

Ambiance: It‚Äôs a super cute and quaint location. They have this nice big window in the front that gives classic NYC small shop vibes. The location at max fits 13-15 people but that adds to the quaintest of it all. They have a gorgeous display of treats and teas which enhances the feel of a small tea shop.  I love the vibe here and would easily come back with a book to enjoy the teas, pastries, and ambiance.

Tea tasting experience was wonderful. We let Garret pick the teas we would taste and just let him know that my husband is a big fan of oolong teas. He picked three wonderful teas and spent a lot of time telling us about the history of Taiwanese teas and the growing, collection, and drying process. Garret knew so much about the teas and answered so many of our questions. It was so enlightening to realize how much time and effort goes into making these teas. We tried the Mt Pyrus, Oriental Beauty, and Frozen Summit  teas. My favorites were the Mt Pyrus tea and charcoal roasted Frozen Summit. I‚Äôve never had a charcoal roasted tea before and I loved the flavor profile. It was so unique and smooth.

Snacks: We got the shortbread, pineapple cake, and button trio. They were exactly as I imagine they should taste. Crumbly and buttery with the right amount of sugar. They complemented the teas really well.

Price: The tea tasting and snacks were very reasonably priced. Between the 2 of us we spent less than $30 per person which is amazing considering they refilled our tea pots 3 times and we were there for over 2 hours.

We had such a wonderful experience here and will be coming back all the time.

Thank you Elena and Garret for making this such a memorable experience.

**minimum $10 for a card payment
Service is quick and the drinks are made to your liking.

I got the Black tea latte with pearl (M) 30% sweetness with light ice which was perfect for me. I don't drink milk tea on a regular basis, but I like my milk tea for the tea taste. I totally forgot to ask for no boba, but the boba pearls were on the mochi chewiness so for some it might be overcooked.

There are seats inside (3 small 2 person tables and 5 chairs next to each other facing the window); however, it is a small place so keep that in mind. Nice Chinese music playing in the background. (Not too loud :))
There are street parking, but when in new york, use the subway/bus :) Less of a hassle.

Taste 9/10 (-1 cause of the boba lol)

Service 9.5/10
Texture 8.5/10 (boba)

Didn‚Äôt I just say I was a novice, AND the first 2 I ordered you only one of the two and only 1/2 of the flavor for the tea. Will NOT go back. Guy in front very nice, guy in back complete jerk.

We had an amazing evening at the Orchid Tea Cafe. Upon walking in, it was a busy but calm atmosphere! Definitely unique decor!

Because the space is so small, we called beforehand to make sure there was a table available, and when we came in, she asked if we called and definitely accommodated us!

Even if I am not in the neighborhood, this is a great spot to travel to when I want a nice quiet, cozy place with a Amazing Food and great service to meet up with a friend or go out on a date

HOW WAS THE FOOD?

We got a special black tea, a hot coffee boba, the volcano mussels, the cucumber salad, and the seafood spaghetti

Volcano Mussels and Spicy cucumber salad (wasn‚Äôt that spicy- but I believe you can adjust spiciness) both were a 10 out of 10

My friend had the spaghetti seafood pasta. She would probably say it was a 7.5/10.

They ran out of tapioca bubbles, so we were not able to try them.

WAS THE SERVICE GOOD?

I believe we were helped by the owner of the shop? We met her son and immediately felt right at home. It was like she welcomed us right in. Even though they were consistently receiving orders, she was still very attentive and answered all of our questions

WILL WE COME BACK?

When I am in the neighborhood, I will 100% be returning back - #1 for the service #2 for the flavor of food ( am a big flavor snob) and #3 for the atmosphere"

They have a couple new bubble tea flavors: Logan Date Milk tea and Rose Milk tea. I tried Logan Date because I never had it anywhere else! Still tastes like milk tea but has chopped up dates (already included in the syrup I believe) which is nice but the skin bits and seeds might throw you off. I‚Äôll try rose milk next time!!
As for payment, they do accept card at a minimum of $10. Just pay cash to avoid the electronic serve fee :)"

I went on a warm Thursday afternoon and was surprised that I was the only patron there. I was a bit put off when the one employee there didn't return my greeting, but it ain't personal.
I decided to order from the kiosk, seems more common in these newer bubble tea shops! I took a while deciding but finally decided to get the strawberry lemonade. Very easy process. Click your choice and adjust sugar and ice levels. I received my drink relatively quick since I was the only one there. I did find my drink a tad too sweet even at 30% (maybe I should opt for 0?). I did receive a goodbye greeting, though, so that was nice!
Quite spacious in there with seats and communal tables. I saw outlets as well so possibly a good workspace (not sure about public wifi)."

It's vastly efficient and implies trust in customers--both wins, however you look at it.

Of the four ice-cream flavors available to sample--tochucha, matcha, hojicha, and koucha--the tochucha was by far my favorite. So good that I ended up getting the Tochucha Yuzu Lemonade, which to be clear, is really a Yuzuade, as the dominant flavor was tochucha and yuzu. It was delicious--perfect for a humid, sweltering summer's day.

The Satsuma Koucha is great if you just want a straightforward Arnold Palmer-type drink, or if you're in great need of antioxidants, the Matcha Coconut Water is a surprisingly complementary combination."

The desserts were also ok, again, for the price id expect a bit more, at least something aesthetically pleasing. The ambience of the tea room itself wasn‚Äôt very nice, the lighting is a bit aggressive and just not very comfortable and inviting.

I posted photos from our tea sampling of three curated teas chosen by the staff seasonally.  They come back to fill your tea pots multiple times throughout so you feel like you get what you paid for in the end.
The prices are really shocking at first glance. They do traditional Chinese tea, not herbal tea or English breakfast (so if you come here for Jasmine tea or something this you will be disappointed)

A great place to go with a close friend or two or even a business meeting. It‚Äôs a refreshing place and a great break for the day or weekend adventure. They have a nice selection of teas and will make recommendations for you. Sitting for tea is an experience and well worth the trip.  The menu is pretty descriptive and they also sell tea to go as well as some beautiful tea cups and equipment. Highly recommended you go for tea.

Whether you fancy a calming green tea or an intense red tea, they have an incredible selection. The staff will also meticulously carry out the ceremony for you and give you recommendations.

Be aware, this place is very expensive and the cheapest option is more than 15 dollars for about 4 cups worth of liquid. Nevertheless if you have any interest in Chinese tea culture, this place will offer an exquisite experience well worth the price."

Location: it is located in Eldridge St in Chinatown, the store was small and me and my friend would have not thought it was a bubble tea place. Lol

Service: they are both nice, they ask us with if we have any questions about the menu.

Food: Me and my friend both ordered ROSE BLOSSOM: it‚Äôs Assam black tea with a hint of rose and sweet lychee and boba. To be honest when he handed it to me, I was looking for the milk! I didn‚Äôt know its not a milk tea lol.. but anyways it was actually good. It resembles like the sweet tea of Mcdonald‚Äôs but way better. You can taste the rose and the sweetness of lychee. The boba was chewy and not hard.

Price rating: 4 out of 10. It is so cheap other than other bubble tea place.

I will come back here to try other flavors! Will definitely ask for milk tea next time!"

It's a small shop with limited seating and a chill ambiance. The staff is pretty friendly enough to help you with the order. I went with Mango yakult and mango popping boba. They added a bit more ice to the drink which is always a technique to reduce the actual quantity. The drink though was medium sized, finished up quickly and yakult never felt like yogurt which is good but was definitely refreshing! I then took out the ice and finished off the mango popping boba which was stuck in the bottom of the glass. Overall a good experience, but would definitely try out their milk tea the next time!"

The tangy, crunchy veggies paired perfectly with the extremely flavorful BBQ pork. The meat is grilled to perfect caramelization, savory and sweet with charred ends. The bread has a crunchy outside and is easy to bite into, not overly chewy.

Egg Tart: The egg tart is really flaky with a milky center that‚Äôs great for dessert.

Taro Milk with Coconut Milk: The boba is rich with brown sugar flavor, and the taro milk is smooth, like a yogurt-like slush with a very unique texture. You can taste the earthy and nutty taro flavor.

Coffee: The coffee is full-bodied, rich, and deep.

Mango Lassi: The mango lassi is smooth with refreshing mango puree."

They serve many types of bubble teas. They have specialty flavors that come about sometimes. I feel like their options are more geared towards tea drinkers and those who like savory teas. They don't have a lot of good sweet options or fruit milk teas. It's mainly a takeout spot and the service was okay, they don't give much flexibility in customizing drinks. I prefer more sweet and creamy bubble teas and this spot doesn't have too many options like that. This time I tried a bay ridge which is advertised as a mango lassi type drink. It was not what I was expecting and tasted more like yogurt than anything else. Mango lassi is usually creamy, sweet, and mango taste but this was very different. Maybe some people like this type of taste but it wasn't for me."

The cool part was we had the place to ourselves, as no one else had reserved lunch at the same time. The waiter was also really nice.

The drinks (we had an infused tea, and a sake drink) were great. I‚Äôd give them a 10/10.

The food (we had the beet/cashew soup, hijiki, salmon app, beef app, shrimp app) were mostly good. The odd part was the beef and shrimp apps had a tomato sauce on them, which didn‚Äôt really work. Not bad, but just would not reorder those.

Portions were much larger than as shown in the menu. We left really full. I would definitely go back to try other options on the menu.

Overall, a special place worth trying out, especially for a special occasion (or to grab a great drink in the neighborhood)."

No sugary powder was used for both drinks, and they were also very adequately sweetened even at 100% sugar. The server was very friendly and walked us through the possible choices based on our preferences, and also explained to us the making process for each of the tea. The Taro Paste was certainly a highlight, using a creamy mixture of real purple yam and taro, and you could taste the little chunks from the yams. The boba was a bit on the harder and blander side for me, but it did not negatively affect the amazing taste of the tea. I would definitely come back here again to try out more of their flavors!"

The house special is very tasty! Adding the oats into the drinks was such a good idea, gives it more texture and taste.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was met with a cold, unwelcoming atmosphere. The staff seemed more interested in their phones than in providing customer service. When I approached the counter to order, the staff was clearly annoyed at being interrupted. I asked for a specific drink with a particular topping, and they responded with a sigh and a muttered, ""We don't have that."" I double-checked the menu, and sure enough, the item was listed. The staff rolled their eyes and begrudgingly made my drink, but it was clear that they were doing me a favor.

When I finally received my drink, it was lukewarm and tasted like a watered-down version of what I had ordered. The boba was chewy and tasteless, and the overall experience was incredibly disappointing. To make matters worse, when I tried to pay, the cashier seemed confused and took several minutes to process my transaction.

As I was leaving, I overheard a conversation between two employees about how much they hated their jobs and how they couldn't wait for their shift to end. It was disheartening to hear them speak so negatively about their customers and their workplace.

I would strongly advise anyone considering visiting Teazzi to think twice. The drinks are overpriced and the service is terrible. There are so many other, better bubble tea shops in Jersey City that offer a much more enjoyable experience. I will definitely not be returning to Teazzi anytime soon."

I got the peach slushie with tapioca 50% less sugar. Still a little too sweet for me but otherwise it's massive. I was so happy only I feel like the price is about what you get since it's one of the more expensive boba. Toppings are separate price as well which is weird to me but it's been the trend.

I have always been attended with great care at this establishment. Out of all the Mr.Wishes I have visited, this location has the sweetest employees.
Certain drinks have more sweetness than others and the lady at the front desk is great at recommending what sugar percentage to get based on your sweetness tolerance. They always prepare me the best drinks !

The Afternoon Tea for One set was a journey through exquisite flavors, starting with an array of finger sandwiches of each one tasty and well-prepared, from the truffle egg salad to the smoked salmon with scallion cream cheese. And the Granola Greek Yogurt, which was refreshing and filled with a great mix of textures.

The highlight for me was the Purple Yam Souffl√©, served with red bean ice cream. It was uniquely flavorful, perfectly fluffy, and not too sweet, definitely a must-try! I also enjoyed the Boba Affogato, a creative twist on the classic affogato.

The Tie Guan Yin Oolong Tea paired beautifully with the meal, enhancing the overall experience with its soothing aroma and taste. Highly recommend Prince Tea House for anyone looking for a sophisticated yet comforting tea experience."

At least the twister fries were super good, crunchy on the outside but soft and fluffy on the insideüçüüòç

ü•™The salmon SLT was pretty good but they could've put more cream cheese and more filling because it was kinda dry. The salad on the side was nice but there wasn't enough dressing so some greens were dry. The salmon itself tastes fresh and had a good flavor and overall good presentation üëç

üç≥üê£ The eggs benedict was alright,  the salmon became cooked since it was left out too long. But their poached eggs were sooo good, perfectly cooked with a runny yolk and very creamy which acts as the perfect sauce for the bread and greens."

We came on a Sunday close to 1pm, and were able to secure a seat right away. We had the afternoon tea for two which cost $70 combined. I would say the price is worth it considering it's unlimited tea and a filling amount of food. I would recommend asking for caffeine free tea for anyone who is sensitive to too much caffeine.

weather is warming up in NYC and Tea and Milk's  refreshing menu of chilled teas + milk teas is a great way to stave that off. this Tea & Milk is in the Pearl River Mart which is in the lower level of Chelsea Market. the small order counter is super clean, colorful, and bright...ordering was a breeze as the menu is divided into ""Concept"" drinks as well ""Traditional"" ones. pick your drink size, sweetness level (by percentage), amount of ice, and add-on toppings/pairings--went with Large Strawberry Rose w/ 100% sweetness & 50% ice plus Boba (tapioca balls). it was so freaking good--the drink was the right amount of sweetness as the black tea flavor and the strawberry puree in the drink mix as the ed. the drink really was cold and refreshing. the strawberry flavor had that natural juicy acidic balance which again paired nicely with the tea. the boba adds that chewy texture to the drink which is nice way to sip the tea as opposed to guzzling it. the staff is friendly & personable as well as gave me the tip to shake my drink before plunging a straw in so the strawberry puree mixes throughout. had to wait a little because they had run out of boba and were making a new batch....no problemo bc you kind find infinite ways to kill time in the Chelsea Market. anyways the boba in my tea was just made fresh so its was extra chewy and sweet...win-win for me. Tea and Milk is well worth the wait and the perfect drink for when you went to stroll through Chelsea Market or the neighborhood and enjoy chilled fresh flavors."

I got the classic with signature cream half sweet. Usually I am good with half sweet but for this one the tea flavor is a little strong so maybe I should have gotten 75% sweet. Still good though. They tell you to shake it up.  They just call out the drinks. Not your name or a number. If they are making them fast enough, they shouldn‚Äôt have any mix ups.

I do like they will sub your milk without additional fee."

You probably have a lot of tourists going there: don‚Äôt make them feel stupid just because you don‚Äôt understand their accent and because they order a ‚Äòpain au chocolat‚Äô which is a chocolate croissant in the US.

I tried their blueberry crumb muffin and it was good as well. The peach and raspberry muffin was just mediocre.

Their iced latte is milkier than I prefer it to be but still the coffee taste wasn't completely diluted. I would try their flat white next time."
New York,coffee,Ground Central Coffee Company,ChIJyQ5DNwNZwokROgxq0fj06is,"800 2nd Ave, New York",4.4,Suzanne B,"I‚Äôve been to this location a few times over the past year. It‚Äôs on my way home from my Dr‚Äôs appointments, so I make it a point to stop in to have a hand-made hot drink (I recommend the Matcha latte; made without sugar, it‚Äôs an excellent combo of creamy dense foam & flavorful green tea‚Äîthey have flavors too,like Lavender, Maple, or Rose‚Äîwhich I haven‚Äôt sampled due to added sugar). The first time I stopped by was because their neighbor up the street (a florist/cafe) referred me to them. The staff were so nice! Delighted to see they have several vegan options, I bought 2 pastries to go, & they were delish‚Äîmoist, flavorful & satisfying! Of course I just had to sample their hot drinks, so a few months later I stopped by to order the above-mentioned Matcha Latte & the vegan banana bread. Same friendly staff. I sat near the door, with a sunny view onto Second Avenue. (Only drawback: smokers tend to linger in front of the place; I had to chase one away due to the noxious smoke entering the open door, ruining the flavorful meal I was having!) On the latest visit, ambience was still great (GC has several locations in the city, which I‚Äôve gone to for takeout, but this, my first GC, is still my fave); the banana bread was gone, but they had a new (to me) vegan chocolate brownie which turned out to be a superb match to the cappuccino I got (more on that later)‚Äîa little too sweet for my taste at first bite, it devolved into a bitter undertone, & then swept me into its chocolately core. Amazing! The staff was not as sharp as I‚Äôd experienced previously‚Äîmy cappuccino order is pretty specific (I‚Äôve honed it over years going to Starbucks!), but as I watched the barista make my drink, I saw him pour the milk into the coffee‚Äîa no-no for me, since it dilutes the decaf, so I always request that they scoop the foam, not pour). He started over, and, after I repeated the instructions I‚Äôd given the cashier, made it to my order. It was SO well made, I ordered another! So this is why they get 4 stars instead of 5 on service. The place is small & can get cramped, so 4 stars instead of 5 because you may not find a seat at all (if I remember correctly, the seating capacity might be 4-6!) But if it‚Äôs a nice day, get your order to go‚Äîthere‚Äôs a small garden-like plaza a few blocks north on the same side of Second Avenue, so you can enjoy your meal al fresco (they do offer a limited choice of sandwiches & cold bottled drinks‚Äîbut I‚Äôve mentioned what they really do best here). Bon App√©tit!"

I called the police and she noticed and hid in the building next door, but a couple of minutes later she appeared as if we had fought. There's a big difference between her assaulting someone and just fighting each other. The Gregory manager said their CCTV hasn‚Äôt been working for more than six months, so there was no way for her to prove anything she assaulted me and ran away.
What kind of coffee shop CCTV doesn‚Äôt work for more than six months? I want to ask the owner. Why didn‚Äôt you fix your CCTV? NYPD requested CCTV but the manager said our CCTV has been out of working for more than six months. Like I don‚Äôt care?

The music was nice like at a dive club.
And they had plenty of snack options like you'd find at a Starbucks.

I recommend this cafe for work or a date.

This is probably just a New York thing with prices at this point, but look at the sheer amount of ice in my drink. It was 70% ice for such a high price."

New York,coffee,BROOKLYN PERK Coffee,ChIJ2YqlOQNbwokRBJ9RCuFz9dk,"206 Parkside Ave, Brooklyn",4.4,First Name,"I hate to do this, but there is a clear and apparent difference between the level of customer service given by the new European (? going off accent ?) barista and literally every one else who works here. The new barista started with other new baristas too so I‚Äôm not sure what the excuse is for her. She does not prepare the beverages to the level of quality I have grown to expect from this establishment as a regular customer. Her demeanor is short and rather unfriendly, especially when customers request her help. I guess she dislikes when she has to stand up and address us because she tries to sit for the entirety of her shift if she can help it. A few weeks back an unhoused woman locked herself in the small bathroom for over an hour and when customers complained she did absolutely nothing, called no one, and ultimately ignored the issue until her shift was up and then left it to the next girl to address. Furthermore, anytime this specific employee is working she never plays music. I‚Äôm serious. Complete silence and whatever noise is happening on the street. One of the many times this has happened I finally said something and she lifted her finger and only stated ‚Äúlater.‚Äù She did not play music later, or at all because she never does on her shift but when the other baristas come in she pretends like she was playing music and just so happened to be disconnecting from the speaker. I‚Äôm sorry about the length of this but I‚Äôve held my tongue for months hoping someone would correct this very noticeably unprofessional behavior but I guess not. Her performance takes away from the wonderful nature of the rest of the staff here. There are too many people capable of fulfilling all aspects of this position for her to be allowed to not even show up and do the bare minimum. I pray some changes can be made because ultimately she (and only her alone) causes a noticeable shift in the environment that is not professional in the slightest."

Shakshuka with a korean spin. It is spiced with korean gochujang. The brunch was very filling even it only contains red bell peppers, cheese and egg. The toasted thin sourdough on the side is perfectly crisped with olive oil drizzle. Will 100% order this dish next time.

ÔºäHummus w. Roasted Mushrooms**
The mushrooms are well seasoned and blend with the hummus well. It is also served with four to five toasted sourdough on the side. I would like it a bit more if the hummus was smoother.

Variety Coffee Roasters is my go-to for a solid cold brew fix. It's fast and the coffee is consistently good, though it'll cost you a few extra bucks. The music is pretty loud, which can be a plus if you need an extra boost, but not ideal if you're looking for a quiet workspace. The staff gets the job done, and the crowd is a mix of people working hard, chatting away, and some interesting characters ‚Äì from homeless folks to punks and kids out of school.

My ‚òïÔ∏èü•õ‚ú®cappuccino was really creamy, balanced. Nothing to complain.

Also my first time trying polenta cake which was an item they got from bakery outside. It was too dry for me so I won‚Äôt recommend."

After placing my order, I noticed there were two other customers waiting for their order. It appeared that they ordered the same drink, since the barista made the same drink twice, but the second customer corrected the barista, she ordered a decaf oat latte, but was almost poisoned with a regular milk latte. Next it was time for my order, but the barista and the cashier were so distracted by the mishap that they forgot about it. About the same time a group of people came and placed their order, when I saw them receive their orders, I knew they forgot about me. When I approached the barista, she didn't apologize, just cursed under her breath, luckily a few people from that group ordered an iced Americano as well, so they gave me one that they were making. The coffee was decent."

Inside, they have regular tables perfect for working and high tops. They also have outdoor seating--a couple of tables in the front and more and in their backyard area.

I ordered the Avocado Toast ($12+) with Egg ($2+). Their avocado toast is: house-made avocado mousse (non-dairy), sliced avocado, Himalayan sea salt, smoked paprika, lemon zest, feta cheese and brown butter served on sourdough bread.

The avocado toast was exactly what I needed after yoga. The egg was a little too runny for my taste, but it was very tasty. The sourdough bread was nice and fluffy and the feta complemented avocado so nicely.

Looking forward to trying more dishes and sitting outside next time."

The decor is cute with the little stuffed llamas. The staff are friendly and laid-back, just like the vibe of the cafe.

I recently visited for some coffee, and while the coffee itself was amazing, my experience was marred by an issue with cleanliness. I needed to wash my hands, but unfortunately, the sanitizer machine wasn‚Äôt working. There was a small basin nearby, but the employees informed me that guests weren‚Äôt allowed to use it. I completely understand that policy, but as a paying customer, I was disappointed that they couldn‚Äôt make an exception in this situation.

The barista was very kind and offered napkins, which was appreciated, but it wasn‚Äôt quite the same as actually washing my hands. It felt a bit off-putting that despite being a customer, I wasn‚Äôt able to use a basic amenity when it was needed. Hopefully, they can improve the accessibility to handwashing options in the future."

I came here twice. The first time I tried the Hawaiian latte. It has a very strong coconut taste, not too strong coffee taste. To me it was so-so but it is just my taste as I do not really enjoy coconut.
The second time, I had a latte and avocado toast. The latte was amazing! It is a very different flavour to usual lattes you may get at another coffee shop. The coffee was rich and flavourful. The avocado toast was not very good. It took a really long time for them to serve it. When it arrived, the toast was quite burnt. The avocado did not have much taste or seasoning and seems like something that is worse than what could be made at home. I would come here again for the coffee but not the food."

Our experience at Ralph‚Äôs coffee was just amazing. The friendly ever courteous staff to the lovely ambience. Both friend and I got the iced vanilla latte. I chose mine with almond milk it was just perfect. Also got the maple glazed crueller to share which was good too, next time will be trying the coconut cake which looked delish. The prices are just right for the experience. If you‚Äôre sitting in, there‚Äôs a time limit of 45 min max which I felt is plentiful."

It tastes delicious and was pricey at $11.75 with oat milk but a different experience and would definitely recommend it as a place to try or work out of (they have a printer!!!!!) in NYC. From what I saw, there are a few baked good options and homemade chicken empanadas. They sell bagged coffee and have some merchandise too."

A small coffee shop off of Canal Street. It's a nice spot to grab a cup of delicious coffee. They offer a variety of options and a select beans from Ethiopia, Kenya, and Panama. They also have a smoothie menu which looked enticing! I was a bit surprised and disappointed that the shop didn't offer any dark roast options. It only had medium blends. Not a deal breaker but would have loved a dark roasted option.

Service: 3 stars
The service was good. Could be a bit more welcoming. There's also no restroom available here. I understand for non-paying customers but if you're purchasing and even thinking about staying and enjoying the coffee, there should be a restroom option.

I am so sorry the owner has his/her employees working in these terrible conditions.

There are several outdoor tables, but only two are under cover. There is standing room at a few coffee counters by the windows.

The drip coffee is smooth and fruity today. I paid $3 for what I think is a 12 oz. cup. Where can you find a $5 latte and an Americano for $3.50? Here! They also have simple syrup and vanilla bean syrup at the milk station to sweeten iced drinks in no time.

Some businesses or doormen know me by face.  I use this location a few times per week. Sometimes the other location at Park Row. Most of the time I wash my hands before getting my coffee especially when the barista is busy with someone or with cleaning.
Today around 7:10pm I walk it. The barista was busy with a customer so I decided to use the bathroom first. Besides it‚Äôs a time saving for me. He jumped out from behind his desk and stopped me saying that I can‚Äôt use the bathroom, I have to buy something first. I never saw him before: a very short guy (compare to me), kind of Hispanic or Native American with a strange face expression.(Like I took his lands. He doesn‚Äôt look like a barista at all, more like construction guy).
I was shocked and asked him what does he mean and when he repeated his policy I explained him that I need a coffee but wanted to wash my hands first. That sounded very strange for him so I got my coffee (strange but I tipped him) , told him that all the people sitting there are customers like me and he can‚Äôt tell anyone what to do first or how to do it.

During weekends there's a large table in the back that fits 6 people or so and a couch where 2 more can sit that allows laptops. The rest of the seating is for people having conversations and doing non-laptop things like reading and conversing.

During the week there's another 5 tables were laptops are allowed (most of the cafe!).

This is a nice balance and frankly very helpful so that you can find a place to seat and have a conversation most of the time when meeting a friend. It also gives the place a nice charm missing in places were everyone is at their laptop.

If I know I need to be on my laptop on a weekend, yes, I consider going elsewhere. It's inconvenient at times since I love this place, but that's part of why it is great.

Original review:

It's my favorite coffee shop in the area. The staff is nice, the ambience is great, their coffee and drinks are the best, and their prices are great. If you specify that your order is to stay they'll also use proper cups, not disposable ones, which is also very nice.

For pastries, their chocolate croissant and the tahini chocolate chunk cookies are wonderful."

The h≈çjicha with espresso was pretty smooth and mild, less strong in caffeine than I had imagined which is good. I had it without the vanilla so it's sugar free and can better taste the roasted tea.

This NY one is identical and it‚Äôs even located inside of an Au Cheval restaurant (might be hard to find at first but walk inside the restaurant).

Coffee wise I really enjoyed the strong drip. The flavors are incredible and it does remind me very much of the double shot strong coffees in Tokyo.

My only complaint was the baristas were a bit slow the day I came and of course the pricing is a bit high so 4/5 instead of 5/5 but worth a try for sure!"

They were beautifully presented though."

Inside it‚Äôs dark and because the cafe is connected to another food place it‚Äôs seems like there‚Äôs a lot going on, even at 10am. I had the Black Camo Latte and it was kind of interesting. Not as flavorful as it looked and sounded like but definitely a softer taste. Wish they had more appetizing pastry options. I did not get any pastry so my food rating is just off the late I ordered. If I‚Äôm around the area I would definitely still consider trying more options."

Best donut I've ever had. Way better than the Dutch Oven from Saskatchewan. Just went with classic glaze. Super fluffy, tender dough. Won't be disappointed."

I also like their dulce de leche lattes. The ordering is a little confusing. You have to order at the window then get down the stairs and go to the side window. It would be a little hard for people with mobility issues like handicap people.

The donuts are incredible, the fruit glazed are bright without being too sweet. They also feature top notch coffee roasters and a wide range of other pastries - they are always coming out with inventive flavors and fillings. Just don‚Äôt go too late in the day or they might be sold out!"

The taste is very distinctive and always fresh, with multiple flavours. Prices are very acceptable for the outstanding quality. Staff is kind and very friendly. You can also choose from a menu of  other fresh bakaries. It deserves that fame for its excellence and quality. Overall rating is 09/10.

Cons: The way to make an ord is inconvenient, as there are several stairs with one entrance and exit. There's no front yard with chairs in front of it for coffee and donuts. The shop is very small. It deserves to be the best. Otherwise can't complain."

New York,coffee,Ground Central Coffee Company,ChIJ4xa6sTZZwokRGzn1wE9GBhI,"714 2nd Ave, New York",4.5,E Meerbach,"Edit: went back and got a large iced oat milk latte with an extra shot (3 instead of 2, I was correct that they use the same amount of shots in their smalls and larges, I think!) and it was PERFECT. I know I probably can‚Äôt convince anyone to make 3 their standard and it isn‚Äôt feasible to regularly get additional shot every time, but it was genuinely one of the best iced lattes I‚Äôve ever had!

Got a large iced oat milk latte, and while it was a bit weak, the flavor of the espresso was fantastic - I just wish there had been an additional shot genuinely because of how good it was! I didn‚Äôt find the espresso acidic at all, and it had a wonderful, bright flavor.

I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a shot number difference between small and large iced lattes, but I would definitely go back and try getting a large with an additional shot or just a small. Their pastry case also looked fantastic, but I wasn‚Äôt able to try any of it, so I‚Äôd love to if I get the chance to return!

The shop is a bit small, but they do a great job with the space they have and the vibes are fantastic. I went in around 9:30 and the  (EXTREMELY cool) baristas were hard at work, but there wasn‚Äôt much space for folks to wait for their to-go drinks without sitting down, so it got a bit congested. Fantastic music and theming though - if you‚Äôre a fan of espresso or other less-milky drinks, I‚Äôd definitely recommend getting a drink to go (or just getting an extra shot!)"

You not only get to choose from fun flavors like horchata, or tres leches, but you get to choose the type of beans you want too. They serve regular flavors too, but you‚Äôll be missing out if you don‚Äôt try the hot that‚Äôs at least once.

At reasonable prices, beautiful atmosphere, kind staff with charismatic personalities you‚Äôre not only investing great coffee, but also in responsible agriculture & business practices as they source their beans from Puerto Rico. They bag their coffee in biodegradable pouches giving nostalgia & sustainable ;)

[+] Prices are really good
[+] Bubble Tea tastes really good
[+] Location is really good (conveniently located close to Subway station)
[+] selection is really good (so much to chose from)
[+/-] there is nearly always a line
[-] no plant-based milk alternatives
[-] staff is not always the fastest

I can strongly recommend this place IF you are not in a rush. I have not found the staff unfriendly (like mentioned in some other reviews), but have been asked to come back to pick up my Tiger Milk Tea twice already (after standing in line for approx. 10 mins each time)... so, yeah, bring patience. They seem to have an app, which makes ordering ahead possible (see pictures), so maybe that is an option IG you are in a rush but still want Bubble Tea :)

There are vegan options,  but not for milk teas, as this place does not offer plant-based milk alternatives. Can adjust sugar and ice levels to taste."

The pictures make it look great until you eat it. I have the video example as well that we can show, the french fries were so hard and inedible and the chicken poppers remind me of the popcorn chicken I got back in High School.

We were fine waiting especially since it was1:30 PM and we know some businesses are busy but y'all really got to check the temperature of your fryers. At least be careful serving that to someone if you're advertising it in your front board of the store.

Overall store was very nice, the person taking our order was respectful and I liked the addition of the tv right in front of you when sitting. Just didn't like the food experience! At the end of the day its a Tea House."

Initially we wanted them to come on site at our NYC office location at make fresh bubble tea as people came into the office, which they do offer, but the building had a lot of specific requests which made it difficult to coordinate. We ended up deciding to switch to a delivery of 100 bubble teas in the morning for my event that same afternoon. From start to finish, they were very easy to work with and responsive. I stopped by the shop and Justin worked with me to decide on what would be best for delivery and what flavors would be good options. I even requested they add my company‚Äôs stickers to the cups along with their own and they did. Delivery was a little tough (but that was due to the location of the office in midtown, police officers not allowing vehicles to stop, etc.) but we eventually found each other for delivery and they helped bring the bubble teas into the building within the delivery time discussed.

As for the bubble teas during the event, we decided on 50 white peach rose with strawberry popping boba and 50 passion fruit with mango popping boba. They were a HUGE  hit and mostly gone within the hour from the start of the event which we didn‚Äôt expect. We were anticipating some leftovers by the end of the day, but in the end, there were none.

Pricing was reasonable and comparable to other quotes that we received. Brian was great to work with. We would look to work with them again in the future!"

Location: it is located in Upper West Side. The location is small, no seating inside.

Service: nice guy in the cashier, he even told me not to order 100% sugar on my tea. I ordered and waited for him to call me.

Food: I can‚Äôt pronounce the tea but I got PU-ERH MILK TEA, the tea has different taste on it and it was really good. I wish they put the description at the bottom of each tea that we are not familiar with. The boba is soft and chewy, they cooked it perfectly!

Price rating: 7 out of 10. Almost $8 for a large

I will definitely come back when I am craving bubble tea! I want to try the other milk teas that I am not familiar with."

Since they didn‚Äôt have the first to bubble tea is that I asked for I picked something else out the guy from the backyard. That‚Äôs not even a bubble tea! Rude condescending. Didn‚Äôt I just say I was a novice, AND the first 2 I ordered you only one of the two and only 1/2 of the flavor for the tea. Will NOT go back. Guy in front very nice, guy in back complete jerk.

My party ordered 3 drinks and they were all made really quickly (by just 1 worker!). The atmosphere is simple and cute and the worker was friendly. I would come here again! Also, they offer business cards at the register that have boba stamps, a buy 9 get 1 free deal. 3 down, 6 to go (in the near future for sure!!!) Thank you :)"

I got the brown sugar oolong milk tea. Beautiful presentation for a plastic container. They were out of large bubbles so I got small bubbles. The taste of the milk tea was fine, what one expects from a milk tea. However, it seemed a bit lacking - perhaps for its price which is a bit higher than other places for I have been for the same size."

Prices are reasonable.

Some people have suggested to share the large (26 oz) option between 2 people.... if you like Bubble Tea, just get 2√ó24oz instead. The 26oz option is large for one person, but not really enough for 2 people in my opinion ;)

Note: They have plant-based milk options for the Tea Lattes, but NOT for the Milk Teas. After asking, one employee told me the milk teas are non-dairy, but afterwards specified that he called it non-dairy because they use milk powder instead of liquid milk (so these are not vegan)."

It was good and much needed. The only caveat is that there's only one kiosk to order from so for someone who is trying this place for the first time, I would've liked to see my options. But I was in a hurry and ended up getting my drink before the couple at the kiosk were even done placing their order. Other than that, would recommend trying if you're in the area."

It brings back memory of what bubble tea used to taste like waaay back in the days.  (sugar water with artificial flavoring and coloring) I cannot believe now they charge close to $6 for a cup of flavored water. (Used to be $3).

Now, it is so much easier to find Asian drinks tasting 1000x better than what this place offers.  Especially in China town.

What is not easy to find are seatings, which this place has.  (Not much business given how uncompetitive the drinks are). This is why I am giving 2 stars instead of one."

We inevitably made our way to Flushing and was craving milk tea. We saw Chun Yang Tea. We have one too back in Bay Area but have yet to try it. So anyway, we ordered their raspberry oolong tea and their oolong tea latte with egg pudding. The drinks came out in a timely manner. We found nothing wrong with the drinks flavor wise. They have a good selection as well. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre the absolute best but it gets the job done.. and it‚Äôs better than quickly and other basic chains."

**minimum $10 for a card payment
Service is quick and the drinks are made to your liking.

I got the Black tea latte with pearl (M) 30% sweetness with light ice which was perfect for me. I don't drink milk tea on a regular basis, but I like my milk tea for the tea taste. I totally forgot to ask for no boba, but the boba pearls were on the mochi chewiness so for some it might be overcooked.

There are seats inside (3 small 2 person tables and 5 chairs next to each other facing the window); however, it is a small place so keep that in mind. Nice Chinese music playing in the background. (Not too loud :))
There are street parking, but when in new york, use the subway/bus :) Less of a hassle.

Taste 9/10 (-1 cause of the boba lol)
Visual 10/10
Service 9.5/10
Texture 8.5/10 (boba)

I would recommend this place, but next time I order, I will order with out pearls haha and maybe try a specialty drink."

That being said their customer service is the worst and each time I've gone there its gets worst. The workers are seriously beyond rude. I am not going there to make friends or a conversation but I  do expect common  courtesy and respect. Not doing me any favor. Rather spend my $$ money elsewhere. Since this location opened I probably spent at least over $400 bucks and usually place orders around $50-$60 each time. One star for the teas!

I‚Äôve worked in a spot similar to Yaya, so I understand how business can be. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having a fun environment and synergy with your coworkers. But you need to be attentive to your customers too, that‚Äôs what keeps them coming back after all!"

Lil M also stands out from other boba places since they have claw machines (where you can actually win! Look at all my prizes) and food/snacks on top of drinks. My top drinks currently are the brown sugar milk +tea and the fruit master. For food, you have to try the wings. They‚Äôre huge, super crispy, and delicious!

The staff members are incredibly kind and welcoming, making you feel right at home. Nikki is especially friendly and always ready with great suggestions if you're having trouble deciding.

We've been on a mission to try every drink on the menu, and so far, everything has been fantastic.
If you're not a fan of super sweet drinks, you can adjust the sweetness level. They also offer non-dairy options for their milk drinks, making it inclusive for everyone.

Cobra Tea offers a variety of add-ons for your drink, but the boba here has the perfect texture‚Äîchewy and just right. They also have lychee jelly, some of which are shaped like hearts, which is a charming touch!

The food offerings are equally impressive. My sister tried the ube toast naka and the Japanese strawberry fruit sando, and she absolutely loved both! Everyone in my family is a big fan of the real coconut pudding‚Äîit's a must-try!

This spring, Cobra Tea began offering omakase, and it was an amazing experience! The food was delicious, and Rudy made sure to explain each dish so we knew exactly what we were eating. His personality and attention to detail in the presentation made the entire experience fun and memorable.

Cobra Tea is more than just a bubble tea place; it's a wonderful cafe where you can relax and enjoy high-quality drinks and food. Highly recommend!"

Their ""regular"" sugar level is already too sweet, and they don't give you enough time to explore their extensive menu. This makes it difficult to customize your order and often results in a drink you don't actually want. If Kung Fu Tea dialed back the sugar and gave customers more time to choose, they could be a great option for a healthy and refreshing drink."

The bread has a crunchy outside and is easy to bite into, not overly chewy.

Egg Tart: The egg tart is really flaky with a milky center that‚Äôs great for dessert.

Taro Milk with Coconut Milk: The boba is rich with brown sugar flavor, and the taro milk is smooth, like a yogurt-like slush with a very unique texture. You can taste the earthy and nutty taro flavor.

Coffee: The coffee is full-bodied, rich, and deep.

Mango Lassi: The mango lassi is smooth with refreshing mango puree."

Just bought the Signature Taro Root few minutes before (Sept 2, 2024) but the taste like too much sugar with water, and super creamy. I was surprised they made really quick (idk why). I definitely regret to buy in here. First time and last timer trying this Tea. Hope you improve. Thanks üôè"

They serve many types of bubble teas. They have specialty flavors that come about sometimes. I feel like their options are more geared towards tea drinkers and those who like savory teas. They don't have a lot of good sweet options or fruit milk teas. It's mainly a takeout spot and the service was okay, they don't give much flexibility in customizing drinks. I prefer more sweet and creamy bubble teas and this spot doesn't have too many options like that. This time I tried a bay ridge which is advertised as a mango lassi type drink. It was not what I was expecting and tasted more like yogurt than anything else. Mango lassi is usually creamy, sweet, and mango taste but this was very different. Maybe some people like this type of taste but it wasn't for me."

Though service can be improved. This dessert is loaded with toppings and is great for 2 person. It has popping boba, peanut, raisin, taro ball, coconut jelly, herbal jelly, sweet ice jelly, and purple rice.

Herbal jelly is much softer than other store. The taro ball is on the soft side, does not have the chew I want. Sweet ice jelly is really light. Milk tea is a bit too sweet, only used half for the dessert. Overall, really like the mix of texture and flavor I can get with this dessert and will definitely get it again.

Ordered online for pick up, did not even start the prepare way after the pick up time."

Yummy Boba has to look out for the neighboring bubble tea places like Nom tea and Mochick! Unfortunately, I do think they might have a leg up. Yummy Boba is right below the D line tracks so it does get quite loud when the trains go by. Atmosphere wise, the floral theme and bright lights help boost visibility of the place. The barista was really nice too but I was rather bummed they were out of earl grey that day. I settled for a caramel bubble tea with pudding. Pretty good and standard! Seems like drinks only come in one giant size. Unfortunately, I have to deduct points for the ""seaweed"" cake that I spontaneously bought. For $12, I did not taste or see any seaweed. Perhaps they only used seaweed flakes? It should definitely be renamed as pork floss cake because that was the majority of the topping. Although the taste was OK, I felt duped. There is other savory food on the menu such as chicken wings and bento boxes. Maybe there's redemption there, but I can't trust the desserts!"

Their menu is pretty good. As a first timer, I had one of their fruit tea drinks. Nicely made and tastes good.

Definitely will come back to place to try more of their other drinks and maybe their food/appetizers in the future. I hope this place stays open for a long time. Lots of potential and a good business overall."

New York,bubble tea,ViVi Bubble Tea,ChIJIcY3f9tPwokRjmuGZbn6tjM,"532b Forest Ave, Staten Island",4.5,Adam Lee,"Finally. A place where you can enjoy proper Bubble Tea in Staten Island. For all newcomers to this East Asian treat, a simple milk tea with tapioca pearls (""bubbles"") is always a safe bet and an original to the genre of beverage. If you're feeling risky, try the 3Q Milk Tea, which adds pudding and herbal grass jelly on top of the aforementioned milk tea with pearls. Otherwise another safe bet for most Westeners is Taro slush or Mango slush, with pearls.

Don't be afraid to try any combination of drink and extra topping, be it jelly, pudding, herbal jelly, aloe, or red bean. You're bound to find something you like!

Service is quick, and are always welcome to answering questions and giving suggestions!"

On the upside, they offer a rewards card, which is a nice incentive for repeat customers! Not too sure if I will be able to reap the rewards however as I don't frequent the neighborhood often. The shop is clean and inviting. The staff member who took my order was friendly as well. Additionally, the convenience of parking within the shopping center is a plus. I tried 3 drinks from here and one of the drinks, a Matcha Fresh Milk Tea, was enjoyable as it wasn't too sweet compared to other places.

However, there were a few drawbacks. For instance, I found it a bit odd that the cup used was not flat, which made it more prone to toppling over when placed down. Moreover, I found the other drinks I purchased to be quite lackluster. The Rose Milk Tea w/Peach Crystals had actual rose stems and so I found that a bit off-putting since I almost swallowed them 5x. On top of that, the peach crystals were not as I expected as they seemed to be overly pureed. As for the Brown Sugar MT, the drink was decent although not too memorable. All three large drinks were priced at $6.75 (w/o toppings) and my order turned out to be approximately ~$24.

Probably will not go out of my way to visit this particular shop but if I find myself in the area, I might give their other drinks a try."

I loved the option of no ice on the tea , because I ordered in and did not want the ice to mess the taste"

For me it‚Äôs all about the simple things and the high quality simple ingredients that really make a place. Everything we tried was obviously amazing but the attention to detail really stands out here..the ginger dressing on their salads for example beyond fresh and pungent and flavorful. The noodles they give you in the hibachi ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a basic side item.. but so fresh .. the flavor I can‚Äôt pinpoint it.. salty sweet peppery buttery tangy.. it‚Äôs all there! The veggies are not over cooked at all super crunchy .. the quality of the fish and meat is perfect nothing overly salted so you can actually taste the meat! Oh and I almost forgot , their soup that comes with the hibachi .. holy bicycles! It‚Äôs perfect sooooo much flavor it must have some kind of bone marrow broth because it‚Äôs extremely filing and not overly salty at all!"

I was satisfied with my beverage, I order the strawberry tea boba and it's a 10/10. The tea with the strawberries mixes very well together and it was very refreshing. With with the boba balls they were chewy and delicious. I will recommend for those to come and try not just their boba, but other meals as well."

I love how open the restaurant is. There's plenty of seating available, but it was quite empty despite it being a Sunday afternoon when we went. Ordering through the touch order screen is easy. Not all the items on the menu has a photo though. Not that each item needed it, but from a user and design POV, it's inconsistent.

Portion: 4
The portion is pretty standard, and the price is pretty on par with what I see in other restaurants. Specifically, I'm talking about the size of the drinks. In terms of ingredient portion, the takoyaki has very small pieces of octopus in it compared to the actual size of the takoyaki ball. At first, I thought there wasn't even any in it! For a pack of 6, it was pretty expensive for flavored dough with a tiny octopus. The size of the tapioca is tiny! The texture is also a bit hard so maybe it's a little undercooked.

Flavors: 2
Everything about their food is sweet. I ordered my drinks with 30% sugar and it tastes like it was the regular level of sugar. They were super sweet. The crab soup was more sweet than salty. It was also very milky. I felt like I was drinking flavored milk rather than crab soup. Not much crab/seafood flavor either so I'm not sure what I'm paying for. I think that if you're ordering drinks, be sure to order it at 0% sugar.

I am not sure that I'd go there again. My husband and I were in town and wanted to grab some drinks and snacks to have at home. After eating their food, my stomach feels heavy. Probably because of all the milk and sugar in their food. For having spent nearly $60, we were pretty disappointed with everything. If you're a fan of super sweet food, maybe this is the place for you. Otherwise, I'd advise the chefs to go 75% lighter with all the sugar. The staff was nice and laid back though."

It really is dry in the middle but nothing prepared me for this horrific experience. The texture was definitely off kind of like am I chewing on soft plastic or very stale bubbles prepared a week or two prior. It was so bad I just couldn't finish it and dumped into the trash. The girl that ordered after me caught up to me in the street so I had to ask her if her bubbles were strange and she said she had a hard time chewing them. I don't recommend this location, unless they had an off day or something."

Ordering was smooth and easy. Took few minutes for it to be ready. Sadly the drink wasn‚Äôt close to King Fu tea standard. It was so watery. Bubbles were stale too. Couldn‚Äôt even finish the drink half way. Hopefully I‚Äôll go back someday to give it another try and order some snacks too."

Yet I ordered it today and was charged extra. The receipt indicates ""No Bubbles"" and then ""Bubbles +$"".

Was it just a mistake? I don't know how the job works, but I'd imagine they're aware of which drinks include toppings with no added charge. I would much rather order via the app, but they indicate they close early on the app... even though the store actually stays open for over another hour."

My favorite drink is their Lychee refresher which is very good as a pick me up during hot weathers; I tried the avocado smoothie for the first time today and it was way better than my expectations.

I also really like that there is sushi and boba and other foods like ramen which makes the store very convenient.

Overall a very nice and friendly experience!"

Very clean and crispy air flow so we decided to dine-in.  We just wanted to try the quality of their sushi and were quite satisfied.  Where else can you get 4 pieces of fresh Sushi for $5?  I‚Äôd like that the ordering process is self serve and efficient.  Also like the music while waiting for the food.
Went back the same evening and ordered a party platter.  Bravo!!!  Good quality and excellent value.   $45 for 10/11 rolls.  Rather than giving you big chunks of fish sloppily wrapped in rice, the Chef did a good job in designing the platter.  Each pieces were evenly cut and well put together.   We ordered popcorn chicken also which was okay.
I suggest they check their website as it is hard to find the correct location and menu.
Bonus:   I believe they have a loyalty system based on spends.  We got a free bubble tea.   Nice!!!

The space is narrow with only 10-12 seats but there is a gender neutral restroom, which is great. The staff is cool, reluctant and rude sometimes.

Our favorite is their Kung Fu Milk Tea with bubble, half sugar and less ice. Their bubble is braised with honey, chewy and sweet. The milk tea is not cooked from great tea leaves so the caffeine isn‚Äôt strong."

He wasn't ""unfriendly"" but then again, he wasn't ""friendly"" either.

There were two small chairs next to the register and all three of crammed into that section of the store. It was also a bit dark inside. I think if we just went by with the drink quality and did a carry-out, I would rate this place higher."

Kind of a high price for something that turns watery within 10 minutes. The drink comes in a skinny taller cup and is not filled to the top. The store has a lot of options of drinks but does not have the jellies or pearls listed as add-ons. I liked coming here but didn‚Äôt realize the heavy price increase.

The best tasting boba I‚Äôve ever tasted in my life they were rich not like many places different flavors don‚Äôt taste so good because they be skimping the mix however this place the bobas bussing
Mind you I am a big fan of boba
I always get flaming brown sugar unfortunately they didn‚Äôt had so I took taro which I‚Äôve tasted before but wasn‚Äôt my favorite now I can honestly say every time I go to this place I don‚Äôt mind trying random flavors because they slapping
Very friendly staffs I saw 2 young lady and they were very nice and patient also they had a smile on their faces
I got 2 tea so yes ik how it tasted
Do not hesitate people"

They are both good but I prefer the original flavour more. The chewy texture is different, not unpleasant, just not what you normally expect from a waffle.

Definitely glad we tried it."
New York,bubble tea,Momo Ashi,ChIJwRMHEpdhwokRoQG7IoTwWz8,"40-06 Bell Blvd, Bayside",3.8,Emily Chao,Cute and casual cafe offering reasonably priced bubble tea and snacks. I ordered a passion fruit green tea with rainbow jelly and a earl grey wamochi. The passion fruit green tea was sub par but alright for the price. The jelly was alright as well. The earl grey wamochi though was excellent. The earl grey flavor was full bodied and fragrant but not overly so. The waffle texture was mochi like. Every bite was crispy on the outside edges and hot and chewy on the inside. I would totally order this again and probably in different flavors. There is a restroom here and several high tables for seating.

Under ‚ÄúStaff Picks‚Äù they listed a passion fruit green iced tea which indicated in both the photo and description that it had lychee jelly and tapioca pearls. Nowhere did it say those were suggested toppings. The cashier asked if I wanted any toppings and I said ‚Äúas is‚Äù with the lychee jelly and tapioca pearls listed in the photo and description. I ended up being charged 75 cents extra for lychee jelly. False advertising, I won‚Äôt be returning when there are other similar bubble tea places in the area."

I usually get the classic bubble tea, and I‚Äôd love for the Earl Grey aroma to be stronger. Today, I tried the galaxy drink, which was perfect for a hot sunny day. The only thing I wish is that they played work-friendly music instead of party music, but I understand I may not be their target clientele."

I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in NY but I felt like I was back in TX since he was so friendly.

I had an interesting experience here. The worker, who may be the owner, seemed quite friendly, greeting regular customers by name and remembering their routines. Naturally, I expected a similar warm interaction when I greeted him, but our exchange didn‚Äôt go as I‚Äôd hoped. He was busy, didn‚Äôt make eye contact, and my order seemed to fall through the cracks. After waiting about 15 minutes, I noticed my order hadn‚Äôt been started, which was disappointing.

Ironically, I had gotten off the train one stop early to treat myself to a nice breakfast. Initially, it felt like a great idea, but things didn‚Äôt go as planned.

However, 5 stars for the team members who did step in‚Äîthey made my coffee and food quickly and were quite efficient. Sometimes, we have to appreciate the good parts of an experience and move on from the less-than-ideal moments. I‚Äôll definitely give this place another try."

It was good, and I‚Äôm impressed by the decent pricing. Better pricing than other coffee shops nearby. The quality was good.

The only drawback would be that it isn‚Äôt just a coffee shop, and as a result, coffee isn‚Äôt the main focus of their business. So if you just want coffee, perhaps there other places will satisfy your needs. This is more deli-like. üòå"

For anyone who likes cafes and flower shops/plants, this is a dream location. Fantastic decor and atmosphere. I was already intrigued when I saw the name of the cafe and I initially thought it was a mistake. The other reviews confirmed it was real but nothing beats seeing the place in person.

no smiling n/or happy face from the staffs. both look tired

The Almond Croissant was tough and chewy, but at least its crispy. Did not taste very sweet or much like almonds at all."

They also have a cute patio in the back. The only bummer is that they have signs on most tables that prohibit laptop use. I would understand enforcing that on off-work hours but who would be coming to a coffee shop at 2pm on a workday without a laptop?! There were several tables open but they said we couldn't use our laptops on them so we ended up crammed on a side table until a spot opened up on the long table they had by the entrance."

I've been coming here since I moved to the neighborhood and I have to admit they stole my heart! Every visit feels special: from kind staff and welcoming atmosphere to creative drinks and outstanding food. The owners also work here, so you can be assured you will get the best treatment!
I've tried their sour, as well as sweet, crepes and I loved the variety of them. My favorites are smoked salmon and prosciutto crepes. Always freshly made and mouthwatering! They have a good choice of baked goods and desserts so you'll definitely find something to your liking. I've tried many carrot cakes in my life and can definitely say their cake is the best! Moist and moderately sweet. The coffee is so good, I never leave without a bag to enjoy it at home.
The atmosphere is uplifting yet, invites you to get lost in your thoughts. I am looking forward to the warmer days when I can relax in their cozy backyard and enjoy my most favorite breakfast or lunch."

We ordered the French toast, and the staff let us know it had alcohol in it. Since we don‚Äôt drink alcohol, they quickly made us a new one without any fuss. It was delicious and exactly what we wanted.

The cafe itself was cozy and welcoming. The staff were super friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were happy. It really made our visit special."

The coffee and tea were top-notch, and the sandwich was particularly impressive. While the french toast was a bit too sweet for my taste, it was still enjoyable. The only minor drawback was the ventilation, which left my clothes smelling slightly oily after a short stay. Overall, White Noise Coffee is a great spot to enjoy a meal or a drink in a relaxed and welcoming environment."

The Cortado I got was excellent, the double shot does make a difference.
Pastry is obviously not made in house but decent enough when you need sugar.
Pricey? Well of course, welcome to Manhattan"

The coffee is really good. I ordered a decaf flat white with macadamia milk and it was perfectly smooth and strong.
The music was nice like at a dive club.
And they had plenty of snack options like you'd find at a Starbucks.
The decoration was also nice - like Gotham from batman.
I recommend this cafe for work or a date.
A but pricey though. A little over $5 for the flat white because they charge $0.75 for the plant miks."

Small to medium sized space is perfect for atmosphere, but may not always have open spots. Solid variety of seating (bonus if you can snag the couch!). Incredible natural light with floor to ceiling windows. The drip coffee was solid. They use counter culture beans and have 2 options: light or medium roast. The light roast was a bit nutty for my tastes, but it was brewed well and flavorful. Served a bit hot. Additional amenities: bathroom, outdoor seats. Note: ownership should consider lowering temp on the AC. Drip coffee score: 4/5. Everything else score: 4.25/5. Overall score: 4.25/5."

It gets a ton of great light, which is nice. I really wanted a snack but they were all out of food, which was unfortunate. I ordered the Thai coffee which is basically espresso, condensed milk and regular milk. I asked them to leave out the regular milk and the result was pretty intense lol. It was sweet and strong. Still not sure if I liked it, but it was my fault for modifying it. I‚Äôd welcome the opportunity to come back and try a snack and the same drink made the right way haha."

I was in the area, and wanted to have a cup of coffee, and spend time with one of my journals.  There was no indoor seating available, but this was a nice, mildly warm sunny day on a Saturday, in the Lower East Side, after 3:30PM, so I was not surprised there was no indoor seating available.  The coffee was very strong, the apple pastry was lovely and delicious.  The staff was super professional and the person who took my order was very outgoing and friendly.  I did not see a bathroom, but was not looking for one, so it is OK.  Being Cuban, I can fully appreciate a strong cup of coffee, and look forward to returning, when I AM back in that area."

And the cinnamon sugar is a close second. I also like their dulce de leche lattes. The ordering is a little confusing. You have to order at the window then get down the stairs and go to the side window. It would be a little hard for people with mobility issues like handicap people.

You can also choose from a menu of  other fresh bakaries. It deserves that fame for its excellence and quality. Overall rating is 09/10.

Cons: The way to make an ord is inconvenient, as there are several stairs with one entrance and exit. There's no front yard with chairs in front of it for coffee and donuts. The shop is very small. It deserves to be the best. Otherwise can't complain."

I chose mine with almond milk it was just perfect. Also got the maple glazed crueller to share which was good too, next time will be trying the coconut cake which looked delish.

You can have your meal there and maybe you will have to wait some minutes in order to have your table, if not you can order for take out. I suggest waiting and having your meal there. It's really worth it."

It has so much personality and flavour - the branding is fabulous and the story behind the place is so nice as well! I ordered the horchata (rum infused - non-alcoholic) upon recommendation from Sebastian who was really sweet. It comes in a cute little bag which is unique in itself. It tastes delicious and was pricey at $11.75 with oat milk but a different experience and would definitely recommend it as a place to try or work out of (they have a printer!!!!!) in NYC. From what I saw, there are a few baked good options and homemade chicken empanadas. They sell bagged coffee and have some merchandise too."

Paola professionally welcomed us big her shining smile (a rarity in NYC coffee stores) and she presented the great variety of coffee flavors the store offers.

A little on the sweeter side but I love that they have all of the different milk options available on the menu. I had the New Yorker sandwich and it was not good.

It‚Äôs very simple and fresh, and just the right amount of acidity. I needed to ask what was in it, and the barista said it‚Äôs a bit of rice vinegar. (I need to try that at home myself.) coffee was good and all, but I‚Äôll definitely come back for this avocado toast! (And sweet baristas.)

PS: 4 stars for the atmosphere because the shop is a tiny tiny hole in a wall. There is a counter seating that can fit maybe 4-5 people tops.  You may not find a space to sit. But still worth a visit."

This place is so much more than just iced coffee with milk, they really bring a uniqueness to their drinks. I‚Äôve had the matcha, lavender honey latte, the red latte, and my favorite drink: a flat white. I would go back for all of them. The bagels are delicious, my favorite is the fromage bagel.

Downstairs area - which most photos highlight - are pretty good, but it‚Äôs like a hit-or-miss situation. Opening or not depends on the staffing on that day. There is no public WiFi for customers in the coffee shop. Need to take elevator to use the restroom. Overall, it‚Äôs a pretty chill place that you can spend some time reading or hanging out with friends."

And the freshly baked goods here are just amazing! Pastries, croissants, doughnuts - everything is deliciously crafted with great skill.

But what truly sets this place apart is the atmosphere. The cozy interior, pleasant music, and friendly staff - everything is designed for you to enjoy the moment and feel at ease. It's perfect for a solo morning coffee or catching up with friends.

We got drip coffee and a flat white both days. The coffee was the best we‚Äôve had in the city. No frills just delicious, well-made coffee.

Service was so dang fast. Like they were handing it to us when I finished paying!

The shop is really small but cozy. Love the small details like the plants and the lending library. No seating but they do have a standing bar against the window and a space to doctor up your coffee if you need to. I also really appreciate the pitchers of simple syrup instead of sugar packets."

Birch has now started making 'fresh in-house' nut milks using numilk. I can't say it does anything extra for their drinks, but it's also not a negative.

Her response was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how it is‚Äùand did not remedy the problem, ignoring us after that. The large drink was basically filled to the size of the smaller drink.

The red headed male employee thankfully stepped in and told her to fill up the cup properly. Two stars because the situation shouldn‚Äôt have been an issue in the first place."

But then the drinks after mine were full so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just the Americano drink itself so I didn‚Äôt ask.

I called the police and she noticed and hid in the building next door, but a couple of minutes later she appeared as if we had fought. There's a big difference between her assaulting someone and just fighting each other. The Gregory manager said their CCTV hasn‚Äôt been working for more than six months, so there was no way for her to prove anything she assaulted me and ran away.
What kind of coffee shop CCTV doesn‚Äôt work for more than six months? I want to ask the owner. Why didn‚Äôt you fix your CCTV? NYPD requested CCTV but the manager said our CCTV has been out of working for more than six months. Like I don‚Äôt care?
In this coffee shop, I had the worst day of my life!!!!! Never gonna try this coffee shop ever!

The service at Perk is fantastic. It's an amazing local shop if you want to stop in and just get a really good cup of coffee for the road, but Perk also has an amazing atmosphere. If you're looking for a coffee shop that has that vibe of a NYC coffee shop that you'd see in Friends or a movie, Perk is definitely the coffee shop to go to. It's an awesome place to sit down and read a book or get work done while having some of the best coffee in town."

I would recommend the almond croissant. There are quite a number of customers with computers working in the cafe, for which I guess the cafe provides a nice and quiet environment. There are a variety of coffee and snacks too."

Coffee well brewed of a Colombian medium roast. So if you know you like that profile, this is a good choice.

Cocoyam beans are quality and darker, more bitter roast for an intense coffee flavor. Staff are kind and helpful. They also have wifi for work and some pastries. I ordered the cinnamon roll which was perfection - lots of icing and fluffy and sweet. A bit pricey $6.50 but still worth it in my opinion. I wonder if they bake in house?
I also ordered a decaf latte with oat milk and it was good. Tables inside are small and there is only one plug so hard to work from by I made it happen."

The shop itself was small but cute. There were tables and it was busy when I went. The staff seemed nice. I only stepped in for a short bit but will probably come back because the coffee was good and the atmosphere was nice."

After all, when you do so, it is just espresso and milk! Very tasty coffee, and I will admit to just falling for the marketing. Also wasn‚Äôt that into the coconut coffee, a little too sweet. I think we just ordered poorly as everything else does seem good and the espresso and regular latte I had were great."

Walked in today and greeted the barista, at which point he just looked at me until I got to the counter, same as first visit.

They also provide freshly brewed coffee beans and come merchandises. The dine in area isn't that big, but once we got seated, it feels quite comfortable here.

I tried their Cold Brew Single Origin 12 oz for $6.
A cup of cold brew with abundant ice cubes. It's a refreshing coffee that isn't bitter and sour."

This coffee shop is so easy to visit, for both locals and tourists.

I always like to order my all-time favorite drinks, iced New Orleans coffee. They really do a great job on this one so I highly recommend.

I was there just yesterday and the AC was down. I wish there were more seats inside the shop - it‚Äôs quite small and not a very ideal option if your looking to find a place to sit and hang out with friends."

Went for the 2nd time‚Ä¶ the service wasn‚Äôt the same as last time.

The book nook is awesome."

Only feedback for owners:  Weekend staff needs an attitude check. 5 min before close, I pay for an espresso. But because they‚Äôre *about* to close, they can‚Äôt give me the coffee in a ceramic cup. Guys, I know you want to go home but it‚Äôs still business hours and you‚Äôre serving a customer. Don‚Äôt be entitled. Anyway, after I begged, he said ‚Äúfine I‚Äôll get you your ceramic cup‚Ä¶‚Äù.

It‚Äôs like how Prince‚Äôs ex said it was hard to date after Prince cause Prince was PRINCE. Anyways, I really like that Espresso Tonic."
New York,coffee shop,Birch Coffee,ChIJVQZ5bif2wokRdOKgFt-pfL4,"750 Columbus Ave, New York",4.3,Ari H,"Let me start off that the coffee is excellent.  It‚Äôs the best coffee shop on the UWS and it‚Äôs not close. I‚Äôve been a patron here for about 2 or 3 years. I visit daily. It adds delight to my day.

Over the last few months, I‚Äôve noticed that there is low grade misery on the faces of the staff here. So much so that there has been a turn over in employees. No one wants to stay here.

My feedback for the leaders at Birch is your coffee is good but don‚Äôt forget your people are what make it an experience. And I‚Äôd posit that you‚Äôre not treating your staff in a way that fosters a positive work experience, so they end up quitting. I recognize that you want an exit that leads to a size-able financial return. But at what cost? To be another Starbucks?

I encourage you to foster a better culture that‚Äôs employee focused. I‚Äôm not aware of the leadership at this location but I can tell you it‚Äôs not the right fit.

Also, protect JJ, Joe and Milo at all costs. If they leave, I‚Äôm not sure I can stick around. Stop moving the tables around, it‚Äôs dumb.

Good businesses make money. Excellent businesses make a difference."

But often they forget to put a plain croissant in the App. I came there today  and said that I couldn‚Äôt order a plain croissant through the App since they didn‚Äôt put it there . I expected them to do it right away - they usually do it. But today i was told to go and wait in line in order to buy it.  I was very surprised. Their service is normally good.

New York,coffee shop,BROOKLYN PERK Coffee,ChIJ2YqlOQNbwokRBJ9RCuFz9dk,"206 Parkside Ave, Brooklyn",4.4,First Name,"I hate to do this, but there is a clear and apparent difference between the level of customer service given by the new European (? going off accent ?) barista and literally every one else who works here. The new barista started with other new baristas too so I‚Äôm not sure what the excuse is for her. She does not prepare the beverages to the level of quality I have grown to expect from this establishment as a regular customer. Her demeanor is short and rather unfriendly, especially when customers request her help. I guess she dislikes when she has to stand up and address us because she tries to sit for the entirety of her shift if she can help it. A few weeks back an unhoused woman locked herself in the small bathroom for over an hour and when customers complained she did absolutely nothing, called no one, and ultimately ignored the issue until her shift was up and then left it to the next girl to address. Furthermore, anytime this specific employee is working she never plays music. I‚Äôm serious. Complete silence and whatever noise is happening on the street. One of the many times this has happened I finally said something and she lifted her finger and only stated ‚Äúlater.‚Äù She did not play music later, or at all because she never does on her shift but when the other baristas come in she pretends like she was playing music and just so happened to be disconnecting from the speaker. I‚Äôm sorry about the length of this but I‚Äôve held my tongue for months hoping someone would correct this very noticeably unprofessional behavior but I guess not. Her performance takes away from the wonderful nature of the rest of the staff here. There are too many people capable of fulfilling all aspects of this position for her to be allowed to not even show up and do the bare minimum. I pray some changes can be made because ultimately she (and only her alone) causes a noticeable shift in the environment that is not professional in the slightest."

When we passed  by again after eating she ran out of the store to greet us from across the street and ask us how the food was. We asked if the cafe was still open and she asked us from across the street what we wanted and welcomed us back. She was SO SWEET! The bear shaped cookie was amazing, too.

ÔºäShakshukjang**
Shakshuka with a korean spin. It is spiced with korean gochujang. The brunch was very filling even it only contains red bell peppers, cheese and egg. The toasted thin sourdough on the side is perfectly crisped with olive oil drizzle. Will 100% order this dish next time.

ÔºäHummus w. Roasted Mushrooms**
The mushrooms are well seasoned and blend with the hummus well. It is also served with four to five toasted sourdough on the side. I would like it a bit more if the hummus was smoother.

ÔºäAvocado Toast

The beans are freshly roasted and have a nice balance of acidity and flavour. My only suggestion would be to offer more flavour options - maybe a French roast or Italian roast?""
Overall, I'm so impressed with the quality and flavour of these drinks! The perfect spot to cosy up and indulge in a delicious beverage.5/5 stars"
New York,coffee shop,About Coffee,ChIJy4JbCThZwokR0r51DUEjozc,"445 Columbus Ave, New York",4.2,PhilYouIn,"Some coffee shops offer a lived in, restaurant type atmosphere. This place is set up as if they think they may have to pick up and run at a moment‚Äôs notice. Some table, some chairs, mostly bare walls. Two women working very hard behind the counter, charging prices you would expect to pay on the Upper West Side. Dressed like they are in their home. Coffee was good but the place is not for me."
New York,coffee shop,About Coffee,ChIJy4JbCThZwokR0r51DUEjozc,"445 Columbus Ave, New York",4.2,Clay Patrick (ClayDay),"Great atmosphere, service, and chai. The iced chai with oatmilk I got was delicious. It leaned more toward the spice side than sweet if I had to describe its flavor. The barista behind the counter was helpful and was able to get my order out in under a minute."
New York,coffee shop,About Coffee,ChIJy4JbCThZwokR0r51DUEjozc,"445 Columbus Ave, New York",4.2,Holden Miles,"Although the service was very nice, the location itself was hard to work in. Their lack of AC made it very hot, they have no bathrooms for customers, and the WiFi was incredibly slow forcing me to use the Starbucks wifi from across the street. Their espressos are really bitter so if that‚Äôs your preference, I recommend their double shot. Their morning bun was also fine but tasted a bit too salty- something I‚Äôd rather do without for a sweet pastry."
New York,coffee shop,About Coffee,ChIJy4JbCThZwokR0r51DUEjozc,"445 Columbus Ave, New York",4.2,JP,"I was excited seeing this cafe serves coffee roasted by gimme coffee. The cappuccino was great. Food/pastry options were limited and the interior felt a little simple, not as inviting as other cafes in the area. I liked that they featured art of a (local?) artist inside."

First of all the ambiance when you first walk in is nice from the color palettes of the chosen decor to shelves on the walls. We found a nice spot to sit at and the table were cleaned right away.  We actually got to meet the owner who is kind , personable, and passionate about his business. The baristas were very nice, fast and aware and accommodating of your needs. We were only to grab a coffee but ended up seeing the cream cheese selection and got breakfast here too. The orders came out quick and when we are in NY again we will come back."

I‚Äôm staying in the neighborhood for a few days and set out this morning in search of a good pastry - and ultimately chose the Grind. After some perusing, I ordered their Greek Yogurt Cheese Danish (which appeared to have some jam in it as well) and an Americano. 10/10!! This pastry was fantastic. The jam was delicious and the cheese not too sweet. Felt like a dainty little cream-cheese-and-jelly sandwich for an adult?

Great start to the morning. Only shame is I didn‚Äôt get a photo before devouring the pastry. Try it!"

It's velvety smooth, bold, and exactly the kind of quality that's somehow only becoming a rarity nowadays. They seem to pull it off with ease, which is simply impressive. This place has earned its spot on my list of must-visit cafes, right alongside Frisson's. If you're ever in town and looking for an authentic espresso experience, this cafe is definitely worth stopping by. Can't wait to make it my go-to spot the next time!"

2024 update:

Variety Coffee Roasters is my go-to for a solid cold brew fix. It's fast and the coffee is consistently good, though it'll cost you a few extra bucks. The music is pretty loud, which can be a plus if you need an extra boost, but not ideal if you're looking for a quiet workspace. The staff gets the job done, and the crowd is a mix of people working hard, chatting away, and some interesting characters ‚Äì from homeless folks to punks and kids out of school. Overall, it's a decent coffee shop with a unique vibe, especially if you're after a quality cold brew."

Since I go later I usually get a chai latte, which is super yummy and not too sweet or intense of a flavor.

I can find a seat most of the time, for there are a lot of tables and seats including a booth in the back. Lots of accessible outlets as well."

Nice to be here on a sunny afternoon. They‚Äôve got benches on the side of the street and the surrounding environment felt cozy.

Most importantly, a fellow customer kicked the iced latte I left on the ground and the staff was nice enough to make me a new one for free. That was a very kind gesture.

Loved it."

It‚Äôs hard to find tumeric anything in the city so I was surprised to find it here and they don‚Äôt do it iced due to the grainy texture of the spices.

My ‚òïÔ∏èü•õ‚ú®cappuccino was really creamy, balanced. Nothing to complain.

Also my first time trying polenta cake which was an item they got from bakery outside. It was too dry for me so I won‚Äôt recommend."

After placing my order, I noticed there were two other customers waiting for their order. It appeared that they ordered the same drink, since the barista made the same drink twice, but the second customer corrected the barista, she ordered a decaf oat latte, but was almost poisoned with a regular milk latte. Next it was time for my order, but the barista and the cashier were so distracted by the mishap that they forgot about it. About the same time a group of people came and placed their order, when I saw them receive their orders, I knew they forgot about me. When I approached the barista, she didn't apologize, just cursed under her breath, luckily a few people from that group ordered an iced Americano as well, so they gave me one that they were making. The coffee was decent."

Inside, they have regular tables perfect for working and high tops. They also have outdoor seating--a couple of tables in the front and more and in their backyard area.

I ordered the Avocado Toast ($12+) with Egg ($2+). Their avocado toast is: house-made avocado mousse (non-dairy), sliced avocado, Himalayan sea salt, smoked paprika, lemon zest, feta cheese and brown butter served on sourdough bread.

The avocado toast was exactly what I needed after yoga. The egg was a little too runny for my taste, but it was very tasty. The sourdough bread was nice and fluffy and the feta complemented avocado so nicely.

Looking forward to trying more dishes and sitting outside next time."

The decor is cute with the little stuffed llamas. The staff are friendly and laid-back, just like the vibe of the cafe.

Overall, Lazy Llama Cafe is the perfect spot for those who want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of NYC. So come on down, take a seat, and relax like a true lazy llama. Trust me, you won't regret it!"

- I came in pretty early at 8am on Sun morning, and the lady working there was pretty cold without any greetings or smiles. However, she was very fast in making my drink!

+ The shop has a good vibe and interesting decor! I think they‚Äôre going after the ‚Äúrustic nature‚Äù theme? They were playing very loud music when I walked in, and I love that as it instantly boosted my energy level (without the needing of caffeineüòÖ)

I recently visited for some coffee, and while the coffee itself was amazing, my experience was marred by an issue with cleanliness. I needed to wash my hands, but unfortunately, the sanitizer machine wasn‚Äôt working. There was a small basin nearby, but the employees informed me that guests weren‚Äôt allowed to use it. I completely understand that policy, but as a paying customer, I was disappointed that they couldn‚Äôt make an exception in this situation.

The barista was very kind and offered napkins, which was appreciated, but it wasn‚Äôt quite the same as actually washing my hands. It felt a bit off-putting that despite being a customer, I wasn‚Äôt able to use a basic amenity when it was needed. Hopefully, they can improve the accessibility to handwashing options in the future."

I came here twice. The first time I tried the Hawaiian latte. It has a very strong coconut taste, not too strong coffee taste. To me it was so-so but it is just my taste as I do not really enjoy coconut.
The second time, I had a latte and avocado toast. The latte was amazing! It is a very different flavour to usual lattes you may get at another coffee shop. The coffee was rich and flavourful. The avocado toast was not very good. It took a really long time for them to serve it. When it arrived, the toast was quite burnt. The avocado did not have much taste or seasoning and seems like something that is worse than what could be made at home. I would come here again for the coffee but not the food."

New York,coffee shop,The Jolly Goat Coffee Bar,ChIJfzFqxVFYwokRKyAbRK6Nhqw,"515 W 47th St, New York",4.5,Chloe Summer,The most amazing coffee I have ever had. The espresso was so smooth and the oat milk was on point which can be hard to come by. With a perfect ratio of flavouring. The merch is so cute and can be a great NOT CHEESY souvenir from NYC and I had to grab a mug and sticker. The cafe itself has a great atmosphere and the man who helped me was very friendly.

Barista could be a bit happier or at least friendly.
I understand long days and you are tired but this was 10am. Overpriced coffees.
Not coming back. Be aware it‚Äôs non dairy milk in coffees."

Pastries look great and there are sweet and savory options. Friendly staff and the seasonal coffee specials are interesting and tasty. My iced americano was excellent."

New York,coffee shop,Green Lane Coffee,ChIJWZsMNCBZwokRacOaeq8yUaY,"1582 1st Ave., New York",4.8,Leah Cranston,"Had a very lovely latte here. The menu is simple, but for good reason. The espresso was excellent and didn't need any modifications for the latte to shine. The cafe was small with minimal seating, but the baristas were so warm that it made the space very cozy and inviting."
New York,coffee shop,Green Lane Coffee,ChIJWZsMNCBZwokRacOaeq8yUaY,"1582 1st Ave., New York",4.8,Catherine Germinario,We love green lane - the coffee is delicious and the service is great!! The only reason it‚Äôs not 5 stars is they frequently don‚Äôt fill the cups all the way up and it‚Äôs a little pricey. They also told me the only difference between their small and large americano is the amount of water rather than an extra shot so I don‚Äôt understand the price difference in small/large
New York,coffee shop,Downtown Coffee,ChIJZz9ZeOtbwokRbp3ES5LyiEo,"18 Delancey St, New York",4.8,Boris Latkovic,"This place is a real gem. Really cool vibe, great art work, the dogs are beautiful and chill, super clean bathroom, and the coffee/Frappuccino is outstanding. Kids friendly as well. We bought a mug to remind us of this place even though we only spent about 40 minutes here, it left that much of an impression."
New York,coffee shop,Downtown Coffee,ChIJZz9ZeOtbwokRbp3ES5LyiEo,"18 Delancey St, New York",4.8,Erin Lanigan,"Found this place by a quick Google search for coffee shops in this area. Stopped in for pastry/coffee on my way to work nearby (I don‚Äôt live in area). Great iced latte, blueberry muffin. Wish I‚Äôd had time to sit inside
For a few minutes, great vibe. Highly recommend!"

We returned a few hours later for the Ribs and Chicken. Each came with so many (maybe even way too) sides.

Excellent food and an amazing vibe. Thanks for the food Momma!"
New York,coffee shop,Downtown Coffee,ChIJZz9ZeOtbwokRbp3ES5LyiEo,"18 Delancey St, New York",4.8,k n,Always a pleasure. Don‚Äôt drink coffee but am always enticed by their offerings. So far I‚Äôve tried the Downtown (I think) and the Allen (pictured). The barista Nailah delivered  excellent customer service and made my drink very quickly. Will be back again to support this neighborhood business.
