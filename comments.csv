So much effort was put into this video. Great job!,9
A very interesting video good work! It's honestly really astonishing to hear that tea is older than coffee with them being rivals for morning drinks,5
"Great video!  This video naturally makes me think of St. Glorianna from the anime Girls und Panzer.  All the girls from that school have an English culture, (despite being Japanese), and the girls in the show have nicknamed themselves after their favorite tea.  Darjeeling.  Assam.  Orange Pekoe.  Rosehip.  Etc.",4
